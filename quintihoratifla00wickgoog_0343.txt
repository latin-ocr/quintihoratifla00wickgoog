ODE XII.

‘lituras is past, and Spring reigns again. The ice is gone, the swallow builds,
shepherds sing their songs in the open air. Come, theu, Vergilius, and inaugurate
thethirstyseasouwithacask os the best wine 1 can get you. But you shall not
come empty-handed; you bring the ointment ii l find the wine Above all, come
witha mind void oi care, and prepared ior free enjoyment’

The chiei interest oi the Ode centres in the question to whom it was addressed.
is it a playiul letter actually seut by Horace on some occasion to the great poet,
and published six years alter his death, not so much ior its intrinsie merits as ior
its reminiscences oi their friendshipr On this theory (aad it has been held by
Dillr. recentiy, and was held by Bentley), we may expect there to be allusions init
which are now unintelligible, though they would probably be well understood by
Maecenas and the many survirors oi the literary circle in which Virgil and Horace
met. Diiring, who also takes this view, points out that the images ol the first three
stanaas hare a special appropriateness as addressed to a poet, aad the poet ol the
Bucolics and Georgica. The chiei difficulties in the way oi the theory, spart from
the absence of any tradition on the subject (ior the Scholiasta all imagine some
other Vergilius to be intended), lie in expressions oi r. 15 ‘iuvenum nobilium
cliens,' and v. ²5 ‘studium lucri! Oi course these can be disposed oi as coverlng
meaniuga to which we have lost the key; but it is rather hard to imagine any
possible meanings ‘Pone moras et studium laen: is exactly the style in which
Horace would address oue oi his ordinary friends engaged in the common paranits
ol the day; but what can it mean addressed to Virgili We cannot really refer it
to the proposed exchange oi wine ior nard, and take it to mean, ‘ Dou't haggle
about the bargain.¹ ‘iuvenum nobilium cliens,' again, is natural enough and com·
plimeutary enough, when some special ‘iuvenes nobiles,' as Drusus and liberius,
are in Horace's poeticai savour, when the lact ol the dependency is notorious, and
the point is the nobility, in the best sense, oi the patrons; but at what period ol
Virgil's lile could it hare sounded lilre a compliment? Macieane is content with
the Scholiast's suggestion that Angustus sud Maecenas are the ‘iuvenes'; but he
cau scarcely have really thought that the possibility oi such an expression was
proved by Horaec's calling Augustus ‘iuvenis' iu r. a. 41. There is, perhaps,
a small indication that the Ode was written near the same time as the last, iu the
parallel expressions ‘Ut tamen noris quibus advoceris Gaudiis,' 11. 13, ‘Ad quae
