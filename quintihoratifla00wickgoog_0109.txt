ODE XXII.

‘Dr me tuentur: Dis pietas mea
Et Musa cordi est’ Od.1.17.13.

The protection irom common dangers aecorded to the poet’s tiocks is extended
to himself. As a child, ‘non sine Dis animosus,’ he is covered by the wood-
pigeons from the snakes and bears oi Mouut Vultur (Οά. 3. 4). Mercury snatches
him from the solly and danger oi civil war into which his ,boyish enthusiasm had
carried him (Od. r. 7). Faunus (Od a. 17)wards off from him the falling uee
Now a woli flies hom him as he wanders unarmed iu the woods near his Sabine
iarrn.

We may compare the Ode with the Epistle (r. 10)addressed to the same Fuscus,
‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus Ruris amatores? ‘Fuge magna*
v. 32. ‘A harmless, pinus liie is the true secret oi saiety arrd os happiness' The
Ode dresses this doctrine iu the garb oi poetry and religion—the Epistle in that oi
philosophy and worldly wisdom. Aristius Fuscus is an intimate friend os Horace,

Annuimns pariter vetuli notique columbi) He appears in S. r. 10. 83, amongst
the crities by whose judgmeut Horace will abide, in S. 1. 9, as the friend who
wiclredly escapes, leaving the poet ‘sub cultro? He is called by Aer. on Epp.
