76 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE XVI.

‘Faue daughter oi a mother sair, though not so sair as you, burn and iorget my
scurrilous iambica. Pession is as resistless as the afflatus oi Cybele, or Apollo,
or llacchua, its expression as noisy and senseless as the cymbala oi the Corybantes.
We are all liable to it, we all have our share oi the lion's hesrt. Yon may
read its effects in all story. Curb your passion3 I too was led astray by it.
Forgive me, accept my palinode and be my friend.¹

‘Tyndaridi satisfacit . . . Imitatus est Stesichorum poetam Siculum qui vitupera·
tionem Helenae scribens coecatus est et postea responso Apollinis laudem eius
scripsit et oculorum aspectum recepit, cuius rei et in Epodo poeta idem
meminit 2—

‘Inlamis Helenae Castor offensus vioe
F raterque magni Castoris victi prece
Adempta vati reddidere lumina? Acron.

‘Hac ode παλινῳδίαν repromittit elin quam probrosum carmen scripserat Tyn·
daridi amicae suae’ Porph.

ln accordance with this the Ode is headed in the MSS. B and A ‘ad Tyn·
dariden.’

‘Cantat palinodiam, ie cantando revocat quae scripserat iratus in amicam
Gratidiam? Comm. Cruq. anemone MSS. head it ‘Palinodia Grandine!
Others unite the two views, and identiiy ‘Tyndaris' with ‘Gratidia' or ‘Canidia ’ς
‘Palinodia Gratidiae vel Tyndaridis!

For the first vien, which identifies the unknown object oi this palinode with the
Tyndaris oi the following Ode, there seems to be no external argument. There
was the temptatioa to connect the two Odes, to malre the invitation oi that the
complement oi the reconciliation in this; and the connexion oi the name oi Helen
on the one side with the name oi Tyndaris, and on the other with the original
‘palinode,' would easily suggest to ingenious Scholiasta the desired linis.

With respect to the second view the case is not so clear. Is the ‘criminosi
iambi’ here recanted are to be loolred ior among Horacc's extant poema, they can
hardly be other than his attacks on Canidia in Epodes 5 and 17. To our ideas it
is a slight recantatioa ior sach a libel, so much so that it might seem to force us to
give bath to the Epodes and to Sat. 1. 8 less reality than we should naturally gire.
There is no bitterness ia this Ode, nothing which would justiiy us in holding (ior
this is one suggestion) that it is acontinnation oi the libel, the ‘tu podica, ta proba’
which he oliered to sing, ‘mendaci lyra,' ⁸ tuning his harp to fnlsehood: in Epod.
17. 39 ; but yet the tone os the palinode is barely serious. There isa moclr heroic
air ia the ‘urbes altae,’ ⁴ 'Thyestes' ⁸ Promethens' (comp. Od. a. 4, 4 11. 25 loll,
and Epod 3). 1t is intended, as Newman says, to make the occasion slightly
ridiculous, to represent both himself and the lady as having made too much oi it.

The παλινῳδία oi Stesichorus, which added to the legend oi Troy the famous
variation that it was onlya phantom in Helen's shape that Paris caniod iram
