The person intended is not known. Acron calls him ‘Cassium maledicum
poetam? The Comm. Cruq. further identihes him with Cassius Severus, an orator
of name (Quint. 10. 1. 147), but a libellous writer (Tac. Ann. 1. 71). He is known
to have died 111. 32, and it is perhaps hardly probahle that he ‘can have written
lampoons such as to attract Horace's unger (as this would oblige us to suppose)
at the least sixty-three years before. Nor is there any hint elsewhere of his having
been a poet. Ritter suggests Furius Bibaculus, who is elsewhere ridiculed by
Horace (see on Sat. 1. 10. 34, 2. 5. 41). and who ls classed with Catullus hy Quin·
