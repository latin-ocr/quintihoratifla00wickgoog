ODE XII.

Tffls Ode seems to be rightly talren by Orelli and Dillr. u a soliloqny put into
the mouth oi Neobnle. ¹ She la one oi the nnhappy maidens who can neither gire
free play to their love nor iorget it over the wine cnp without the dread ot' en
nncle's tierce tongne. She cannot attend to her womanly work sor the thought oi
llebms' hennty--Hebrna, ns he comen truh from bie enlm in the Tiber niter bis

morning's exercite, ior be is the beet ol rideri, boxern, rnnnere, buntrmen!

The older theory made it all an eddrees oi the poet to Neobnle. Bnt in bis
mouth the oontrast ol the lot of men and women is not very graceful‚ nor the con-
nexion between vv. 1-3 and the remninder os the Ode very clear, nor the recitnl oi
Hebrns’ accomplishmmts very appropriate. Ritter, allowing the whole to be pnt
into Neobnle's mouth, makes vv.4-1n the ‘patruae verbere lingnre’ which abe
imagines t'o herself. The uncle, however, would hardly epend the greater part oi
bis scolding in prainingber lover.

Gesner follows Acron in taking the whole aa ironical, ‘Sotadico vemm' The
idea seems to have arinen from nn attempt to interpret the namen, ‘Hebrus'
(cp. r. ²5. ao) as ‘vetulus quidam et odiosnr'; ‘liparaenr' ns ‘brureyedf
‘votem-like! There are no other indications ol rneh ι meaning in the Ode.

The verae which Hephaestion quotes, to illustrate the Ionio metre, irom the
beginning oi n poem oi Alcaeus, ἔμε beliar ἔμε πωσᾶν mnam rebixoeonr, reads
aa ii Alcaens' Ode bed been in some way the original ni this one, nnd it fernum
also the view that Neobnle is speaking in this Ode of herself.
