§ 2. The Alcar'c stanza is found in 37 Odes :-

1· 9, 1⁶, 1111111131113111·

2. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, rr, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 1ο.
3. 1,1,3,4,5,6, 17,11,13,16, 19.

4· 419, 14, 15.

It employs three kinds ο1 verses :-

a being repeated twice.

11 is obvious that we have here variatione of two movements;
verse β repeats and amplifics the movement ol the first half of a,
verse γ repeats the dactylic movement of the second half, putting
the trochees after instead of before it. This consideration proves
that although to the ear the movement of β and ο1 the first half of a
is iambic, it was in idea a sequence of trochees preceded by an
u'nemphatic syllable or ‘anacrusis' The anacrusis is as often short
as long in the fragments of Alcaeus and Sappho. ln Horace it is
occasionally short, but more rarely in β than in a, and never in either
in Book iv.

Alcaeus had admitted a spondec in the place of the second trochee.
Horace made the spondee imperative, see on Od. 3. 5. 17, 3. 13. 18.

The division of the two halves of the line is marked by a caesura,
which is only violated twice, in Od. 1. 37. 14 ‘Mentemque lymphatam
Mareoti00‚’ and 4. 14. ry‘Spectandus in certamine Martio! There
are two other instances where a preposition at the beginning of
a composite word gives a quasi-caesura, 1. 16.11 ‘Hostile aratrum
exercitus insolens,' 1. 37. 5 ‘Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum!
Horace seems to have paid great attention to the rhythm of verse β,

excluding‚ and more carefully in his later poems, all conjunctions of
words which did not by their accent counteract that natural sameness

of movement which we find undisguised in Alcaeus, λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν
(1171111 ἤδη, &c No quadrisyllabic ending or beginning is found in
Book iv except of the forms ol ‘Nomen beati qui Deorum’ and
‘Consulque non unius anni! Verses ο1 the form ol ‘ Gaudes, apricos
necte flores' (1.16. 7) 111 found only in 1. 16, 16, 19, 35, and 2. 1,
3, 13, 14, 19. ‘Hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro' in 1. 16. 11 is unique.
It was the occurrence of these two verses in 1. 16, and ol the verse
‘Alcaee plectro dura navis’ in 1. 13, that called Lachmann's attention
to the wrong date assigned by Franke, on Justinus' authority, to the
