‘Wsaresuiieriugforonrfathers'sius. They let the templesgotoruiu. They
let the saneduess of marriage laws be tampered with. Our blood is poisoned, and
we go from bad to worse. They sprang from diiiereut parents, and had healtbier

T his Ode, though probably written before it, is iu subject the complement oi
the last. It traces to its source the decline oi the military spirit oi which that
complains, and includes in the arraigument Roman daughters and mothers. As
that points to Augustus' plaus oi foreign conquest, so this points to his restoration
oi temples and religious ceremonial (cp. a. 15) and his legislatiou on social ques-
tions (cp. 3. ²⁴3 4. 5. 21 ioli.; Carm. Sacc 17, so). Cp. Suet. Oct. 30, and
Merirale, ch. 33.
