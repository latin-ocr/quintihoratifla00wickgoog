nin. 1. OD.15.

ODE XV.

Neurus beoalm Paris, as he illes with Helen, to toretell tobim hia own sate and
the destruction oi Troy.

‘Hac ode Bacchylidem imitatur ; nam ut ille Cassandram iacit vaticinari lutura
belli Troiani ita hic Proteum,’ Porph. (The last word is a slip arising lrom
u reminiscence oi the prophecies oi Proteus in Hom. Od. 4.) The same statement
ia repeated by a Scholiast on Stat. Theb. 7. 33ο. If, however, the tine verses
which Clement os Alexandria quotes, without giving ibe name oi their author
(Strom. 5. 731 ὁΛυρικός φησι), belonged, as is commonly believed, to this poem,
Horace‘s imitation cannot have extended beyond the mere irnmework.

The lines oi Bacchylides are :-

ab Τρῶες Ἀρηΐφιλοι, Zela ὑψιμέδων, bs ἅπαντα δέρκεται

οὐκ αἴτιος θνατοῖς μεγάλαν ὀχέων· ἀλλ’ lv plag} κεῖται κιχεῖν
πᾶσιν ἂνθρέιιιοιοι Aleae dolor, ἁγνόν,

Εὐνομίας ἀκόλουθον rol πινυτᾶς θέμιδος·

ὀλβίων mltis νιν εὑρόντες σύνοικον.

Fr. ²9 (Bergk).

Τιιε imagery oi llorace's Ode is really Homer's rather than that oi the Greek
lyrists‚ cp. Od. 1. 6.

A Scholiast calls the Ode an allegory oi Antony and Cleopatra, and that ex·
planationof it is adopted by several editors, landinus, Baxter, aud Sanadon. Ritter
drawa tbe parallel out in detail. Paris, hidden by Venus iu Helen’s chamber, is
Antony taking refuge in Cleopatra’s ship at Actium, &c The theory cannot be
pronounced probabis, although it is true that elsewhere (see additional note to
Ode 3. 3) Horace seems to have thought oi Antony and Cleopatra while telling oi
Troy and Helen. Mitsch. remarks that to the Scholiast very possibly the sugges·
tion was due to tbe position oi ibe Ode. The keywbich had unloclrcd the last was
applied to thia Compare the relation oi the next two Odes to one another.

The Ode is imitated by Statius, Achill. i. ao foll.
