EPODE V.

Cnnmln, with her crew ol witches, Sagana, Veia, and Folia, ia engaged in the
taalr ol drawing to her, by spells oi magio, a miserable old man named Varus.
Vr. 1-10, the poem opens with the terrihed prayers oi aboy, who sees dimly that
the haga have some dreadful intent, though he known not what; 11-14, he is
stripped and setin the midst to await their further purposes3 15-24, Canidia gives
her orders sor the brewing oi the magio bowl. 25-28, Sagana aprinkles the honae
with water from Avernus. 29-40, Veia, meanwhile, ia digging in the garden
a hole where, ii this apell proves insufficient, the boy ia to be buried up to his chin,
andleit to atarve, that his marrow and liver may be ingrediens in a more potent
philtra 41-46, Folia plays her part in the incantation. What it war, is lest to
our imagination; we are only told oi her power-she could draw the moon and
stara from the sky. 47-60, Canidia, hali afraid already that her spella are not
successful, appeala to the powers that witness her blaclr arta, that her beloved (an
old sop, on whom she is made to pour contempt ln her very prayer) may come to
her. 61-82, ‘He comes not; what has happened? No herb has been omitted,
nothing that could make him torget other cherma. Ahal she seea it all. He is
nnder the spell ot' some more skilial witch. He shall not get off, however. She
has a stronger charm yet to try, and heaven and earth shall change placen before
she leta hia love go! 85-102, The boy understande her, and interrupta the scene
with a barat of despair, in which he threatens hia tortnrers with the vengeance oi
spirita and men.

The acene is laid in the interior ot a house in Rome, apparently in the Subura;
