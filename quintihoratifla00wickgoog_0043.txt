1122 infant son os Phraates. These events are undoubtedly the objecta
ol reference in Od. 1. 26. 5, 2. 2. 17, 3. 8. 19, and very probably also
in 1. 34. 14-16 and 3. 29. 28. 1f we could date thern therefore with
certainty we should know the earliest time at which the first-named
Odes at least could have been written. And it so happens that this
would incidentally throw light on one or two more points oi Horatiau
chronology, lor 3. 8 is written on an anniversary (it seems almost
necessarily the first anniversary) oi Horace’s escape from the falling
tree. To lix, therefore, the earliest date oi this Ode would determine
as much ior the other Odes which refer to the accident, i. e. 2. ¹3 and
3. 4. Horace's escape again is connected (a. 17. 22-32) with Mae·
cenas’ reception in the theatre on his recovery irorn illness, and this in
its turn gives a date of some kind to 2. ao. The date, however, on
which so much depends is not itseli quite free irom doubt. Justinus
says that Tiridates fled 1ο Augustae, ‘who was at that tirne fighting in
Spain,’ which would fix the date between nc. ay and 24. Dion, on the
contrary, narrares the event under the year 30, and makes Tiridates
lind Augustus in Syria, on his progress through Asia aiter the battle
oi Actium. Mommsen (Res gestae divi Augusti, vi. 2-3) thinks the
two acounts should be both accepted, as giving two stages in the
negotiatione os Tiridates with Augustus, but in that case the relerence
of Horace would probably be to the earlier one. Another point oi
some interest hasbeen supposed to be involved in the date ol Tiri·
dates' flight. Two oi the Odes which reser to this event (3. 8 and 29)
speak also oi Maecenas as burdened with cares ol State in a way in
which no other Ode speaks ol him. ‘Mitte civiles super urbe curas,'
‘Tu civitatem quis deceat status Curas, et urbi sollicitus times!
These expressions have been usually interpreted os the powers which
Augustus is known to have delegated to Maecenas during his own
absence lrorn Rome in the last year of the civil war. Dion 51. 3, Tac.
Ann. 6. 11 ‘Augustus bellis civilibus Cilnium Maecenatem equestris
ordinis cunctis apud Romam atque Italiam praeposuit.’ li the later
date of these Odes were adopted it would seem necessary to assume,
what is probable enough in itself, but not otherwise ascertained‚ th'at
the same powers were entrusted to Maecenas during Augustus'
absence in Gaul and Spain in the years sc. ²7·²4·
