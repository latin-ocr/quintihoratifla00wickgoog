8 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

different classes. One fatal result ol this process is that the evidence
lor the separate existence of class 1, on which Keller lays so much
stress, tends to disappear. The only persistent members ol it are
M and y, both ol them MSS. ol the eleventh century.

It is interesting, however, to observe that whatever weight we assign
to Keller's classilication ol the MSS. it has no revolutionaryeffect upon
his text. The great leature in it, aster all, is tlrae lower oalue attached to
euch MSS. as B and V. This, of course, goes lar in some places to
decide the reading. But ii we compare his text with that of the most
competent and the most conservative critice who immediately pre·
ceded him we shall find the difference comparatively small. We
shall see that he admits conjectures at least as largely as others, more
than many, and that his conclusions, however they were formed, are
supported generally by evidence from the Scholia, or by quotations‚
or by considerations of style, metre, and the lilre ¹.

Before we leave the MSS. it may be the place to say a few words
upon two subjecta which present themselves very early to the reader
· ol any notes upon Horace.

1. The first has been glanced at already. I do not know that
coey'eclural emendation has really been exceptionally busy upon Horace’s
text. That the two are specially associated in the minds oi general
readers is due doubtless, in a great measure, to their greater familiarity
with the author, to the brilliancy ol the conjectures themselves, the
contributione oi a long series ol the greatest scholars from the
Renaissance onwards, particularly perhaps to the unrivalled power,
learning, and eloquence with which our greatest English scholar
recommended the method and its results in his edition of the poet.
