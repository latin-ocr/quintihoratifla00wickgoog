ODE Ι.

‘Mus have different ideas ο1 glory aud happiness—success iu the Olympic games,
civic honours, wealth. The iarmer will not turn trader ior any prospect ol riches,
nor the trader give up the sea tor any danger. One lilres a lite ο1 ease; another
the excitements oi war or spurt. My taste is lyric poetry, and my glo'ry that you
should rank me with ibe lyric poeta ο1 Greece.'

The Ode is clearly written as an introduction, aud there is in it some irony.
(Cp. the tone oi Od. 3. 30, when the work is done.) lt is dedicated to Maecenas,
usis the first ο1 the Epodes, the first ο1 the Satires, the first ο1 Β. i. of the Epistles.

Compare also Od. 4 3, which reculis the main thoughts oi this Ode, though its
confident tone aud the absence of a patron's name point the change which had by
that time come upon the poet’a circumstances. There is uo need iu either Ode to
truce the ‘incongruens’ mention of the Olympic games as among the natural

objects ot ambitiou to the remembrance oi any special Greek original, such as
Pind. Fr. not :-

ἀελλοπόδων μέν τιν’ εὐφραίνωσιν ἵππων
’ τίμια καὶ στίφανοι τοὺς δ’ lv πολυχρύσοις θαλάμοις βιοτά, κ, τ. λ.

The purpose is to give ibe feeling oi a wide survey os human lise, and Horace does
not draw a strong line between the Greek lise which survived in literature and the
actual Roman tiseos his own day. The apology sor poetry, us one among the
various tastes os mankind, is asold at least as Solon (a. 43-52), and Horace would
remember the eud os Virg. G. 2, esp. vv. 503 soll. For the same thoughts in a less
poetical form, cp. Sat. π. 1. 241011. ‘Quot capitum vivunt totidem studiorum Milia:
me pedibus delectat claudere verba, &c'

It should be noticed that, though Horace seems to be only apologizing ior his
own pursuit ο1 writing poetry, as not more unaccountable than the many others
which divide mankind, yet, when he comesto speak oi it, the terms he uses ure
auch aa imply that it is better than any ο1 mem, its pleasure purer, its rewarda
higher.
