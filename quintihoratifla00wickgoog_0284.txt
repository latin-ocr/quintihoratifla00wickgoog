ODE XXVII.

'Evtn omens are ior the evil. ll 1 sear lor you, 1 will at least wish you all good
omens. Go, is you must go, and be happy wherever you are3 and think oi me
sometimes, Galatea. Only remember the season. Ibave reason to know what
a stormy passage oi the Adriatic is like3 may no friend ol mine ever experience
itt Europa didn't know on what she was embarking, till she lound hersell on the
scas and saw nothing but sky and water. Thea she repented bitterly, till Venus
consolari her!

It is possible that the conclusion ol Europa's story loses its immediate point
from our not knowing the circumstances ol Galatea’s joarney. Was she too, it
har been suggested, to lind consolation iu the wealtb and greatuess ol the com·
panion oi her travali There is no passion, though there is tendemess and kiudli·
ness, in the poet's feeling towards her. The Ode contrasts in this respect with the
similar poems ol Propertius (r. 8) and Ovid (Am. ι. ιι).

Iu any case Horace meant people to read his Ode who knew nothing ol Galatea,
and the story ol Europa makes an artistic whole, even il, as is so often the case in
Pindar’s mythological episodes, it only touches at one point the subject with which
the Ode begins. The story ol Europa is told in Ov. Met. a. 847 ioll.
