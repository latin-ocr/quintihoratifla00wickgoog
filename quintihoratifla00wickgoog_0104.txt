LlB. Ι. OD. ¹9·

Et lasciva Licentia
Finitis animum reddere amoribus.
Urit ure Glycerae nitor
Splendentis Pario marmore purius:
Urit grata protervitas
Et vultus nimium lubricus aspici.

Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas ro
Et versis animosum equis
Parthum dicere nec quae nihil attinent.
Hic vivum mihi caespitem, hic
Verbenas, pueri, ponite turaque
Bimi cum patera meri: ¹5
Mactata veniet lenior hostia.
