ODE Ι.

’ Hm the reaching ol the Muses, ye thet ere fit to receive lt. All humen
gresmess is bounded. Kings ere cbove us, but Jove is above lrings; men muy
differ in wcclth end runlr. bnt Deuth makes nc distinction. Tc one who hes the
sword of Dum0cles above his head no leests will teste sweet, no music bring sleep;
yet sleep muy be hed in pccscnts' cols or cn a shsdy river bank. Moderute your
desiree It is not the desire for what is enough for life thet pute the treder's
happiness ct the mercy of ι stormy see, of the fermer's et the mercy of the westher.
The rich proprietor, weery cf the suniericus of the dry lund, builds hcuses ont into
the ωας but fear end conscience andeste ure not to be escsped3 merbles end
purple end costly wines cen't take awsy a paug. Don't usk me, then, to chenge
my happy Seblne vulley for ι pslaoe thet will only bring on me envy, end weelth
thet only increuses trouble!

The exordium suits the beginning of a hook, und also indicates thar the Ode cr
Odes which follow heve some special dignity. The sequence of six Odes in the
same melre, und dealing with the sume general subject, is by itself sufficiently
different from the poet's usual practice to attrucl remark. Diomedes, iu his account
of Hcruce's meires, trests them as one continuone poem, nnmbering Ode 7 es η
und both MSS. end Scholiasts ere inclined to precs, beyond the hcunds ofprobe·
bility, the connexion between one Ode und another (see Introd. to Ode 3, end note
0n41). The unity, however, of general purpose is obvious. The ends sociul,
moral, religione, politiccl, which c good government would set before itself in
Rome erc reviewed, and it is more thren once promised thet Ceessr's rlgime is to
compress them.

This need not, however, imply thet the Odes were ull composed et thereme time,
end consciously us a serice. The invocetion cf the Mose st the beginning of the
fourth is more natuml in cn independent Ode. The sixth seems to be earlier then
’ the rest. The references cf vv. 13-16 ere more eusily explsined if the ‘bellurn
Actiacum’ wus still recent, und the tone is more pessimistic than thet of the other
live. It dwells on the evils without foresecing the remedy es they do. On the
other hund, the indicatione oi date iu the fourth (rv. 33-38) lead us rather to
Augustus' cempeign in Spein mc. 25.
