35⁸ nonan cronon

Labuntur altis interim rivis aquae,
Queruntur in silvis aves,

Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
Somnos quod invitet leves.

At cum tonantis annus hibernus Iovis
Imbres nivesque comparat,

Aut* trudit acres hinc et hinc multa caue
Apros iu obstantes plagas,

Aut amite levi rara tendit retia,
Turdis edacibus dolos,

Pavidumque leporem et advenam laqueo gruem ³5
Iucunda captat praemia.

Quis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,
Haec inter obliviscitur?
