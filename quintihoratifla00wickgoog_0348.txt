LIB IV. OD. 14

ODE XIV.

‘How can senate and people worthily honour thy virtum, Angustus, and traus-
mit their memory to all time? The triumphs oi the Nero brothers, oi Drusus over
the Vindelici, the Genaunl and Breuni, oi T iberius over the Raeti, are all owing to
thy auspices How terrible was Tiberius in the parsum as the south wind on the
waters, or as the river Aufidus when it pours in a torrent from the hills down on
the plain. Thine were the plan and provision oi the campaign, thine its divinely·
ordered succus, ior the victory came on a day already noteworthy lor thy happy
iortnne-just fifteen years aiter the capture oi Alexandria, Thy reign has been
a series oi triumphs, aud now all the world is at thy ieet?

For some account oi Tiberius' campaign in ac. 15 see Inuod. to the Book.
