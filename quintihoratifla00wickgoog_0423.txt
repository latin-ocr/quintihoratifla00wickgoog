404 ΟΝ ΤΗΕ UNKNOWN NAMES

which does not concern Horace himself. On the other hand, many
ol the names are maniiesdy adapted by their etymological meaning
to the ideal personages depicted, as Pyrrha in r. 5, Chloe: in 1. 13,
Lyce in 3. ro, Phidyle in 3131 cp. Sybaris in1.8; the list may
possibly be extended by the names of Lalage in r. 22, Leuconoe in
1. 11, and oi Telephus 1.13,&c. (Horace is iond oi playing on
the meaning ol names, ‘Glycerae immitis,' 1. 33. 1, ‘Bibuli consulis
amphoram,'3. 18, 8.) Some more are adapted to the metre oi the
special poem; as Leuconoe in 1. 11, ‘Asterie ' in 3. 7, and ‘Neobule'
(cp. the name ol her lover, ‘Liparaeus Hebrus’) in the Ionic a minore
mette ol 3. 11. With one or two exceptions the unknown male names
in the Odes (the names ol Horace’s rivals, asin r. 13, on any theory
oi a real Lydia) are Greek names, Telephus, Gyges, Calais; mytho·
logical names3 sometimes the names oi Greek rivers, Hebms3. 11,
Enipeus 3. 7. We may add perhaps that where the designation is
most lull and precise we seem to see most definitely the purpose
ol giving momentary substance to an acknowledged shadow ; see on
‘Thurini Calais filius Ornyti’ 3. 9. 14, and cp. Introd. to 1. 4. In'
a few cases we seem to see the appropriation oi the name to a special
character, as ‘Cyrus' 1. 17. 25, 1. 33. 6 ; ‘Pholoe' 1. 33. 7, 9, 2. 5. 17,
3. 15. 7; ‘TelephuS,'1.13.1, 3. 19. 16, 4. rr. 21. On the other
hand, the same name is at times given to people ol such different
characters or ages, that those who gave them real existence were
obliged to recognize more than one owner ol the name; cp. the Phyllis
oi 1411111 4. rr, the Chloris os 2.5and 3. 15, the Lalage os 1.11
and 1. 5. There are cases where a reality seems to be given to
unknown names by their being brought into close relation with real
persons and events, such as ‘Mystes’ the lost friend oi Valgius, in
1. 9; ‘Glycera' to whom Tibullus is supposed to write piteous
elegies, 1. 33. In this last case, however, we note that Glycera is not
aname that occurs in Tibullus’ extant elegies. How much truth ol
lact underlies the very lew love-Odes in which Horace's own personality
is introduced otherwise than by the mere use of the first person, such
as 1. 33, ‘Ipsum me, melior cum peteret VenuS, Grata detinuit compede
Myrtale ¹,' or 4. 11 in which, alter inviting Phyllis to help him keep
Maecenas' birthday, he addresscs her as ‘meorum finis amorum,’ it
is more difficolt to say.

There is one name, that ol Cinara (Οά. 4.1. 4, 4. 13. 11, 11,
Epp. r. 7. 18, 1. 14. 33), which seems redeemed from a mere shadowy
