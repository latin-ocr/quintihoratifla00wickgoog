HORATI CARMINUM

Ut pura nocturno renidet
Luna mari, Cnidiusve Gyges,
Quem si puellarum insereres choro, ·
Mire sagaces falleret hospites
Discrimen obscurum solutis

of Pbilology, No. 41, has made a suggestion which, on this and other grounds,
seems very worthy of consideration. It has always been assumed that the opening
of the Odeis an imitation of Catullus 11. 1 foll.

‘Furi et Aureli comites Catulli
