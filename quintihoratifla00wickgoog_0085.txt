66 HORATI CARMINUM

Defluit saxis agitatus umor,

Concidunt venti fugiuntque nubes,

Et minax—quod sic voluere-ponto
Unda recumbit.

Romulum post hos prius, an quietum

Pompili regnum memorem, an superbos

Tarquini fasces, dubito, an Catonis
Nobile letum.

Regulum et Scauros animaeque magnae

Prodigum Paulum superante Poeno

Gratus insigni referam Camena
Fabriciumque.

Hunc et incomptis Curium capillis

Utilem bello tulit et Camillum
