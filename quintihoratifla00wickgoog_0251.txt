HORATI CARMINUM

ODE XIII.-

‘Bsnnusu sabinensis sgri regio est inqua Horatii sger fuit,' Aer. The Ode
itself certainly suggests such a locality. The poet seems to be ethome at the
spring. The surrounding objects are too familiar to obtrnde themselves on the
picture The spring, now called ‘Fontans degli Oratim: on the hill-side between
the two suggested sites for Horace's farm, answers well enough to the description.
It gushes out suddenly at the bottom ol s small face oi rock‚ crowned now not by
ilex bnt by a hg·tree‚ nnd irs rusb os cold water, the crystsl clearness os the basin
which it forms, and then the lise with which it snrts to bound sud brbble down
the steep slope to the valley are quite enough to wake s poet’s enthusiasm. On
the other hand, it hss been shown that as late as the twelith century there was a
chnrch standing on a site which can be identified about six miles south os Venonis,
which is named in eeclesiastical documents oi the time ss ‘ Eccl. SS. ΜΜ. θεῖναί
et Protasi in Bandusino Fonte apud Venusiam! lr this evidence be held conclusive
we must either suppose that Horace writes from an sffecuonate memory ol the
Bandusian spring, such ss he elsewhere shows os Mount Vultur, the nestling village
os Acherontis, and other spots near the home oi his boyhood; or. ir ‘cras dona·
beris’ seems too definite ior a mere address oi lancy, we must conclude that at
some period oi his life he revisited Venusia. The sset, however, thst he does not
himself indicate the locslity os the ‘ Fons Bandusise’ msy have caused topographers
to make various gucsses in early times as well ss late, and the Venusisn claimant
ci the name need not be the genuine one. Verses 2-8 are probably interpreted oi
the Fontsnalis, a festival on Oct. η, named by Varro, Llug. Iat. 5, ‘ in fontes
coronas iaciunt et puteos coronant!
