ODES, books l—lll. 27

instinct, ‘parcentis viribus atque extenuantis eas consulto,' which
marks so deeply all his writings ¹. It enables him in Satires and
Epistles to preach without seeming to preach. ln his Odes he would
have his readers take him as the poet of mirth and love (‘ non praeter
solitum levis‚') never to be taken too seriously‚ surprised sometimes into
lofty themes aud genuine enthusiasm‚ but recovering himself before he
has done injnry to subjecta for which heis unfit.

This irony expresses itself within the Odes in' many ways—in the
negative form of such Odes as 1. 6, a. 12, 4. 2, iu the apologetic stanza
which concludes a. 1 or 3. 3, in the half humorousway in which he
recalls his share in the campaign of Philippi in 2. 7. But we miss
a great deal of its effect if we do not notice it also in their arrangement.
Itis this rather than the mere desire for variety which dictates the dis· ι
tribution of the political Odes at long intervals They must not seem
to claim too large a share in the writer's thoughts. It rules also to
some extent the particular sequence in which they are placed. The
most evident instance is the elaborate prelude to B. iv; but there is
something of the sarne spirit in the arrangement which males 1. 2, the
political recantation and profession which he sets in the forefront of
the poems, follow 1. r, in which he has apologized for the poet’s artas
une of the thousand unaccountable tastes of mankind; or again in the
position of r. 12, between the astrologers of Leuconoe and the
coquetries of Lydia ². The same effect is sought again in the light
touch of ⁴ Persicos odi' and ‘Quid fles Asterie,' which follow and
relieve the earnestness of 1. 37 and 3. 1-6.

§ 13. That a certain veil of irony is thrown over thern increases
rather than diminishes our sense of the important place which the
politica] Odes held in the disposition of the three Books. It may even
be suggested that the triple division is due to thern. Not only do they
occnpy prominent places in each book ; they are so disposed as to give
the sense, as between the three Boulis, oi a progress and development
in the poet's politica] ideas In B. i. (a, ra, 14, 35, 37) the rule ol
