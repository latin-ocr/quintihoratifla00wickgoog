LIB. IV. OD. 12. 325

si properas gaudia: ra. ar. The use oi ‘gandia' is sufficiantly unusual to be
noticeabte, and to occur to a writer's mind a oecond time, but less lilrely to have
been repeated at a distanoe oi time. The Scholiasts and inscriptions of MSS. call
Vergilius ‘unguentarius’ ‘mercator,’ ‘negotiator,' ‘medicus Neronum.' All look
as iithey were inierences more or less clumsy irom words oi tlte Ode itseli3 but
the genend impression, in spite oi the temptation to identiiy him with the only
well-known Vergilius, that he was a different and later person, is oi some velue.

The substance oi the Ode is very parallel to one oi Catullus (13), in which he
bids Fabullus come to supper, and bring with him all the materiatis save the
unguent, which he will supply himself, and which he promises shall be so delicious
that Fabullus will wish that he were all nose.

IAM veris comites, quae mare temperant,

impellunt animae lintea Thraciae3

lam nec prata rigent nec fluvii strepunt
Hiberna nive turgidi.

Nidum ponit, Ityn flebiliter gemens,

Infelix avis et Cecropiae domus

Aeternum opprobrium, quod male barbaras
Regum est ulta libidines.

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium

Custodes ovium carmina fistula

Delectantque deum, cui pecus ct nigri
Colles Arcadiae placent.
