Dom. excons. ord. (Excomite Domestica exconsule ordinario) legi et
ut potui emendavi, conferente mihi magistro Felice oratore urbis
Romae! Felix is not known, but Mavortius was consul in the year

x-n. 527. Asterius, consul 494, is similarly connected with the his·
tory of the textos Virgil. Bentley had treated this Mavortian recen·
sion as the ultimate point to which the oldest MSS. might be expected
to take us back. Keller and Holder treat it rather as the first, though
not the worst, source ol systematic corruption. The most important
fact with respect to this class is that Keller places in it B, V with g,
and in respectos many of the readings Α.

The theid class is held to have been subjectetl to earlier and less
intelligent corruption than the second. As a whole, therefore, it
exhibita a worse text, more blunders and fatuities. On the other hand
it is tenacious of the true text where the intelligent interpolators of
class a have obscured it. ln it are placed generally F (εφψ), λ’
(ελ Ι), u, π, tr, and others.

The canon on which Keller and Holder rely in using this
classification is that the common reading of two classes is to be
preferred to that of the third. It is essential therefore to the value of
the system that the existence of the three classes should be clearly
made out: otherwise it is merely the testimony of some of the older
MSS. against others. It is here that criticism has been most
damaging to them¹. Itis pointed out that the natural basis for
the theory of a triple recension is wanting, inasmuch as the existence
of three distinctive variants in doubtful passages is not only not
frequent, it is confessedly extremely rare². The classes are recog·
nized not by distinctive readings but by the general type of their
aberrations from the supposed original text. But here again we
lacis a solid ground on which to rest the division. For few MSS.
exhibit such a type consistently. They pass from one class to
another in successive pages. The grouping in pairs, which again
should be a step towards the grouping in classes, is so far from being
so that the two modes of relating lllSS. are at times at variance. Α
and a, for instance, which are supposed to be derived in large part
from a single archetype, are ranked often for pages together in
