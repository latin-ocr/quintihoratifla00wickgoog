ODE ll.

‘th have seen and l'elt enough ol the wrath ol the goda Onr population ir
thinned by civil war, while the Parthians dely us in aalay. What god can save

our taning empire‚ or atone lor our gnilti Apollo? Venus? onr father Mara? nay a

rather Mercnry, who ia amongst us in human shape, and submitting to be called
Caeaar’a avenger-you must be our prince. Long may you live-stay the civil
war. and cha-stiae the Parthians! '

There is nothing to fix with exactnesa the date of the composition os the Ode.
The portems spoken ol are without doubt those which followed the death ol
Caesar, nc. 44 (Dion 45.17, cp. Virg. G. 1. 466 toll, Tib. a. 5. 71 loll, Ov.
Met. 15. 782 loll), and therefore, however early wc put the Ode, years rnnst have
elapsed since their occurrence. Tbey are recnlled dramatically, not happening at
the moment. The Ode is fitly placed in the forelront ol the three Boulis, aa con-
* taining once lor all Horace‘s palinode and ‘apologia' He is proseasing and
explaining hir couversion to Caesarism. He has thought over the signs ol divine
wrath which followed Caesar's death, and learnt that the act of Brutus war
a crime. The space ol time during which he was learning the lesaon ia lost to
view. The political point of view isanadvance on Epodesyand 16. The‘aoelua’
os Epod. 7 is summed up in one act ol profitless and sacrilegions bloodshed. Α
remedy lor the evils oi the atate has been seen more practical than that propoaed in
Epod. 16. But the grounds alleged are still snbstantially the same, weariness of
the civil war with its horrors at honre and impotence abrond. There is no sorecast
ns in B. iii. ol the special results social and moral to be looked ior from the new
re'girne3 but in the choice os ‘the gentle illaia's son,’ the god of peacelul arts. ol
persuasion and ol commerce, as the deity whom he sees incarnare in the ‘ arenger‚’
he indicates the nature ol the rule he looks to.

Virg. Georg. 1. 466 to the end, should be compared with the Ode as allording
a parallel both in sentiment and in many points in expression.
