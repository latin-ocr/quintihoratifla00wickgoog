ODE Ill.

‘Tun poet is one set spart srom his birth by the Muse’s lavonr; neither his mode
oi iiie nor his objecta oi ambition are the same as other men’s. For them arethe
training and the prizes of Grecian gemes—the life of a soldier and the triumph on
the Capit013 ior him the woods und waters oi Tibur and the glory oi song. 1, too,
sm a poet Rome, the mistress oi the world, aclrnowledges me ns such, and the
voice oi envy is still. It is thy gift, Ο Muse; both the inspiration and the popular
sclrnowledgement oi it:

Compare with the Ode 1. 1, when he loolrs to Maecenus' taste to give him the
rank which here he assumes as given him by the voice oi Rome. There are many
parallelisms oi thought sud expression between the two Odes; there is the same
division oi the objects oi Greek and Roman ambition (‘snnt qnos curriculo pul-
verem Olympicum ’), the same description oi the poet's lile (v. 30 ‘me gelidum
nemus) dre), and of his hope to be ranlred with the Greek lyrists (cp. ‘Lesboum . ..
barbiton‚’ ⁴ lyricis vatibus inseris’ with ‘inter amabiles vatum ponere me choros,’
‘Romanae fidicen lyrae ⁸).
