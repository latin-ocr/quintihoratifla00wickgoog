4 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

of V, whereas in the edition of 1578 he gives ‘Laetus Agylleu’ The
notes, however, show that in his earlier edition he was merely con-
cerued with the variation of ‘ laetus’ for ‘levis’ There are indicatione
that he was aware of the second variation of ‘Agyllea' but set it
aside as having found no other authority for the word. In1578he

“ had found, as he thought, support for it in Strabo, and gives it therefore

as the reading which he had seen in V and was now prepared to
justify. It is such an instance as this which in less equitable con·
struction had led to the imputatione of carelessness and even bad saith
which have been made against him. The general conclusione with
' respect to the MS. seem to be:

(ι) That Cruquius overrated its actual age. According toliis
own testimony it was in cursive writing, and therefore was probably
not older than the ninth century.

(a) That it was of uneven merit, the best readings from it being
chiefly in the Satires and Epistles, while in the Odes it had some
readings which bear signs of interpolation, as Od. 4. a. 6.

(3) That in spite of such limitatione it is of unique value, not
merely as a good MS. amongst other good ones, but as giving, in
parts of Horace at least, some readings which have every appearance
of genuineness, and yet of which there is no trace in any existing MS.
except ing, a Gotha MS. of the fifteenth century, which presumably
gained them from it. Such is the famous ‘campum lusumque tri-
gonem' in Sat. 1. 6. 126, where every other MS. butg reads the

incredible ‘rabiosi tempora signi! ln other words it gives ns access ,

to a tradition of the text independent of that of the other MSS.
