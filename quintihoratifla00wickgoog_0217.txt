198 HORATI CARMINUM

Quam cogere humanos in usus
Omne sacrum rapiente dextra.
Quicumque mundo terminus obstitit,
Hunc tanget armis, visere gestiens,
Qua parte debacchentur ignes,
. Qua nebulae pluviique rores
Sed bellicosis fata Quiritibus
Hac lege dico, ne nimium pii
Rebusque fidentes avitae
Tecta velint reparare Troiae.
Troiae renascens alite lugubri
Fortuna tristi clade iterabitur,
Ducente victrices catervas
Coniuge me lovis et sorore.
