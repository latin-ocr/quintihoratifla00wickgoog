ΟΝ THE UNKNOWN NAMES IN THE ODES.

Α niseussrow of the unknown names in Horace's Odes has no ’

such scope or purpose as it would have had in the last century.
No one would now dream ol renewing the attempts‚ the futility os

which Buttmann and Estre exposed, to construet out ol the Pyrrhus,
Lalages, and Lydias a history ol the poet’s loves and disappointments.
Such attempts involved misconceptions both ol the nature ol his lyrical
genius and ol the chronological relation ol the Odes to his lise. They
are not, like the lyrics ol Catullus, the outpouriug ol the stress and
passion ol youth, but the conscious and elaborate work ol one ‘cuius
octavum trepidavit aetas claudere lustrum! Even with alyrical poet
ol this type it may be true that each poem had an occasion, that it may
touch real life at some point, but the occasion is osten the slightest.
The poet versifies not his own experience only, but that ol others;
a remark at a supper-party, an incident related to him, a casual image
in conversation, are enough to set his fancy working, and the result
is a dramatic sketch ol the situation or feeling suggested. ln any case
the Odes are treated by their author as artistic studies-he arranges
them not in any order ol time, but where they will be most uselul
to relieve more serious poems orto stand as companion pictures.

In spite ol this it may be worth while to point out some obvious
laets about the names that figure in the Odes, lt will illustrate
a feature in Horace's art, and may throw some light by analogy on
the employment ol names in his other poems. Ol the practice
recognized in Latin poetry os concealing the names ol real persons
under Greek names ol equivalent metrical value (as Virgil's Lycoris
for Cytheris, Catullus' Lesbia for Clodia, dcc.) there is little trace to
be discovered in the Odes The Scholiasts, usually so quick-sighted
lor such points, are silent except in the case ol Licymnia in Od. a. ra,
