Aa long as we are content with Quintilian's general exposition, all is simple. The
allegory is satisfied when the commonweaith, in danger of relapsing into civil war,
has become a sea-wearied ship,drifting back into the storm. The masts, the sails,
the plne of Pontus, the Cyclades, belong to the ship, and we must not look for
their exact counterparts in the State. Here, es with other allegorica, we are beset
with difficulties the moment we attempt to tit the details more exactly. lt has ,
been argued, from vv. 17, ιθ, that Horace speaks of the ship as if he had himself
left it (but see notes on those verses), and that the subject of the Ode must,
therefore, be not the State hut the Republican party. Why, others asir, is it
a Pontio pine, not some other—idean, perhaps, as more suitable to the mythical
origin of Romel Acron suggested the answer, which hus since been developed
into a whole theory of the purpose of the Ode. Pompey was the conqueror of
Mithridates of Pontus. The ship, therefore, represents the fortunes of his son,
Sextus Pompeius, whom Horace would dissuade from embarking again in war
with Octavianus after the treaty of Misenum, n. e. 39.

The difficulties of interpretation seemed so great to Muretus, Dacier, and Bentley,
that they refused to allow the Ode to he allegorical at all.

On our view there will he nothing to fix it to adefinite date. The ship is in
sight of harhour. This distinguishes the Ode from Epodes 7 and 16 (see the
introductione to them). It is not yet moored beyond the reach of the wind. So
long as the most timid politician could sec in any movcment a thought of renewed
resistance to the rule which had saved Rome from anarchy, so long might Horace
have vented his leurs, or appealed to the fears of others by this allegory.

A plausible suggestion of Torrentius, which Franke adopts, finds an occasion
