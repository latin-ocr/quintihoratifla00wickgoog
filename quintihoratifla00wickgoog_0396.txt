EPODE lX.

‘wnau shall we have our feast, Maecenas, in your great house at home,
to celebrate Caesar's victory as we celebrated the defeat of Sextus Pompeius
a little while ago? Oh, the shame to think of Roman soldiers in Cleopatra’s
effeminate campi Even Galatian horsemen deserted her, and her fleet would not
fight. why is not the triumphal procession already mering-the triumph of
a captain greater than Marius or the younger Scipio? Our foe has changed his
sentiet for monming, and fled across the sea with no harbonr to go to. Brlng
wine, boy, aad the largest cnps; let ns forget all our qualms for Caesar's
welfare!

Compare Od. 1. 371ntrod., Introd. to Books i-iii, 5 1, and Introd. to the Epodes.
It has been usual to trent this Epode as written when the news from Aetium first
reached Rome. Pliisa (following the suggestion of Biicheler) has argued with
great ingenuity and force for the view that it was written at sea, for an extempore
banqnet on board Maecenas¹ galley on the evening of the battle. He certainly
shows that the langoage suits best the theory of composition on or near the spot.
Itis difficolt to explain away ‘nauseam' (s. 35). Even if it be in part meta·
phorical it is most natural in the mouth of one who has or has had the tossing
ships before his eyes. The emphasis on ‘sub alta domo' points to a eontrast
with the writer's position at the time. ‘Quando‘ in Horace’s usage (‘O rus,
qnando te aspiciam ! ⁹) suggests a sigh rather than a question. Some expressions,
as ‘ sinistrorsum citae,' find their most natural explanation in the mouth of an
eyewitness The exactness of the moment selected, when the battle is supposed
to be over and the flight lmown though its direction is only gnessed,-the rupid
change of feelings‚ disgnst, triumph, scarcely veiled anxiety—the precision of some
details combined with vagueness in the general picture, ull suit a writer close to
tlte scene'of aetion, who sees a part clearly but not the whole, rather than one who
hears the news at a distance. The omission of the event which forms so strilring
a picture in the accounts of the battle by Plutarch and Dion, viz. the bnrning of
the Antonian ficet, is in any ease unexplained. It might perhaps be suggested that
the Epode represents a moment before the action itself, after the desertion of the
Galaticus, and when the delay in offering battle led to some premature rumonr in
the fleet of Octavianus that Antony had fied. On the decisive question whether
Horace was actually present at Actium or not we have no conclusive evidence. ‚lt

Μῑθῦἔὶϋ w, Horace no doubt was also. The professions of Epode 1, and the .'···

indicatione of this one then fall into their place. They certainly raise a presump-
tion that he was. The fact is indeed distinetly asserted in the elegiae poem of
uncertain date ‘in obitum Maecenatis,’ which was attributed, bnt without sufficient
evidence, to Ovid's friend, Pedo Albinovanus, and it is vonched for by Acron on
Epod 1. It has been held to be inconsistent with the statement of Dion (51. 3)
that he was ln charge of Rome and Italy during the campaign, bnt see the Introd.
