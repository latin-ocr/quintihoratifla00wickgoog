which thus became specimens of Horace's later instead of his earlier
handiwork, see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 8.

There is no synaphea between the verses of the stanza, but Horace
twice allows an elision of a hypermetric syllable at the end of the

third verse, 2. 3. 27 and 3. 29· 35. There is an analogous licence
taken in the Asclepiad metre in 4.1.35, and Virgil allows it in the

hexameter, Georg. r. 295, tte.

ξ 3. The Sapphic stanza is found in twenty-five Odes :—
1. 2, 10, 22, 2ο, 22, 25, 30, 32, 38 ;
2. 2, 4, 6, 8, ιο, 16 ;
3. 8,11,14,18,20,22,27;
4. a, 6, 11;
and in the Carm. Saec.
lt employs two kinds of verse, the lesser Sapphic which is repeated

three times-
· υυυυυυ -υ-ξ

and the Adonic-
υ υ “· H·

The materiale of the rhythm in this are the same as in the Alcaic.
lt is a sequence of trochees and dactyls. This is obscured in Horace,
(2) by his excluding the trochee absolutely from the second place,
where it is often found in Sappho, and in her first Latin imitator,
Catullus, ut tt pr) φιλεῖ ταχέως putiau, ‘Pauca nuntiate meae puellae’3
(2) by his eschewing the break before the dactyl, potumi μοι xime ἴσος
θεοῖσιν, ‘Ille mi par esse deo videtur! The lengthening of me short
syllable in 2. 6. 14, ‘Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto,' is perhaps
atrace of the feeling that, as the first syllable of the dactyl, it had the
metrical accent upon it.

The caesura falls commonly, in the first three Books, after the fifth
syllable, ‘lam satis terris,' though it is found, from time to time, after
the sixth, ‘Quem virum aut heroa' In the carm. Saec. and the
Fourth Book, Horace returns in this point to the use of Catullus and
the Greek, and employs the second caesura frequently. In either me
three Sappbic Odes of Book Four together, or in the Carm. Saec.
alone, there are twice as many instances of it as in the twentyoue
Odes of the earlier Books.

There is no synaphea, but hypermetric syllables are occasionally
elided at the end of all the first three verses of the stanza (2. 2. 18, 2.
26. 34, 4. 2. 22, 23, C. S. 47). By Sappho the Adonic was treated
as if it scanned continuously with the verse before, and this use is
