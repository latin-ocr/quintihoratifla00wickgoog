HORACE’S USE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY
lNFINlTlVE WlTH VERBS AND ADJECTIVES.

1. Wr'fh Verba.

Α couerrururnnv, or, as Dr. Kennedy prefers to call it, ‘prolative'
infinitive seems properly to have been allowed only to verbs whose
idea was not complete without such a definition of their scope;
whether the simple verbs that express power, duty, inclination, pur·
pose, effort, beginning, dcc, and the negation of any of these (‘pos·

sum,' ‘debeo’ ‘volo‚' ‘conor,' ‘incipio' ‘nequeo' ‘nolo '); or again
the simple verbs which express the allowing another, or influencing
him, to do or abstain from doing something (‘sino,' ‘patior,' ‘iubeo,'
‘doceo' ‘cogo,' ‘veto' ‘ prohibeo,’ tto). There is a tendency, how·

ever, even in the most classical prose writers to extend the first at

· least of these two classes by including verbs which do not properly

require any such complement, and which therefore, ¹if any further
definition of their scope or purpose were needed, would in strictness
have found it rather by means either of some subordinate clause or of
one of those substantival forms of the verb which could indicate its
special relation more exactly than is possible with the caseless infini-
tive. Thus we find with the infinitive, ‘stude0,' Cic.; ‘nitor,' Nep.;
⁶ quaero,’ Cic. ; ‘ tendo,' Liv.; ‘ pergo,' Cic.; ‘persevero' Cic. Many
verbs hesitate between the two constructions, ‘statuo facere’ or ‘ut
faciam,' ‘prohibeo facere' or ‘quominus facias! The poets go
beyond the prose writers in this extension, greatly because their
diction substitutes more highly-coloured and metaphorical verbs for
the simpler ones of prose, ‘gaudeo’ ‘gestio' ‘amo,' ‘ardeo,' for ‘volo,'
&c.; but Livy and Sallust anticipate some of the boldest poetica}
applicatione of this liberty.

lt seems useless to seek a full explanation of each case in the
doctrine that the infinitive was truly a substantive, which involves
the further difficulty that we must explain in what relation (or ‘case ’l
it stands to the leading verb (see Conington's note on Virg. G. r. 2¹3l·
Α Roman poet felt at once the influence of Greek usage, in which
the infinitive never lost its substantival character, and of Latin prece· '
