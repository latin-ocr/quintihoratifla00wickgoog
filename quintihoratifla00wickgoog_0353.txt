HORATI CARMINUM

ODE XV.

‘Wnunrxu vietmieu efter all, are what Phoebus forbade me to sing of. The
glory of Caesar's reign ls not narr bnt peuce, plenty, the mandards recovered from
Parthia, und the gnte of Janus closed-morality and the old character that gave
Rome her empire restored. While Caesar guurds us, there is no fear that citizen
will lift hand in civil wer, or Dacium Mede, or Scythiae in foreign war. F or us,
every day over the cheerful family heard, when the due libations have been made
to the gods, we will sing, as our fathers sang before us, of the great oaptains of past
time, and of the house of Anchises und Venue’

We een hardly doubt that the Ode is intended us au epilogue to the Book. the
final answer to Augustus’ request. It has been supposed by many editors to carry
internal evidence of having been composed as late es nc. 10. The sole argument
is the mention in v. 9 of the closiug of the temple of Janus, which was taken to
refer to the third elosing in Augustus' reign, which has been pleced in that year.
Frenke shows that the evidence even of this dete is very doubtful, end in any ease
it ie admitted thet the gate was closed in ²9 und ²5, und there isno word in the
Ode to fix the reference to u third closing.

PHOEBUS volentem proelia me loqui
Victas et urbes increpuit lyra,
Ne parva Tyrrhenum per aequor
Vela darem. Tua, Caesar, aetas ’
Fruges et agris rettulit uberes
Et signa nostro restituit Iovi
Derepta Parthorum superbis
Postibus et vacuum duellis

r. increpuit lyra, in the common 3. Tyrrhenum, apparently of elarge
sense of ‘inerepare,’ ‘to re rove,' but and wide sea. Virgil had before used
with reference to its original) meaning, the imageof a poet's ventures, G. 2. 41
‘to make a noise at,' ‘thuudered at me ‘pelagoque volans da vela patenti: end
on his lyre' This mode of taking the Ovid follows, Trist. 2. 328 ‘Nou ideo
words is rendered certain by Ovid, A. Α. debet pelago se credere, si qua Audet
interstitit,territorii? ltftt‘zlit‘ttttltlssthm, φ.
lice fila lyrae,’ &e All the Scholiasts 4.5.18.
toolr ‘lyra’ with ‘loqui’ and Ritter, 6. nostro, opposed to the foreign
of modern editors, follows them. The gods, iu whose temples they bave been

‘Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cyn· at Carrhae were restored in rec. ro; cp.
thius aurem Vellit et admonuit! Epp. 1. 18. 56.
