ξ 15. tt we knew more ot Horace’s relations to private friends or
public characters¹ to whom he addresses Odes, we should possibly see
in more cases than we do an appropriateness in the places assigned to
them. In a few cases it is evident. The position ol Maecenas as the
patron ‘prima dietus summa dicendus Camena' is marked, as 1 have
already noticed, by the dedication to him ol r. r and 3. 29· lt is
marked also by scattering the other Odes addressed to him at measured
intervals as careiully as the politieal Odes. We are never to be long
without hearing his name ². For the contrasted position which he
occupies in B. iv, see introduction to that Book.

lt is interesting to notice in the first three Odes os B. i, that the
name which stands next to Maecenas and Caesar is that oi the poet
Virgil, the sriend to whose introduction to Maecenas Horace owed his
lortunes. It hasbeen pointed out as probably significant that the nest
three Odes addressed to real persons (4, 6, 7) bear the names of men
with special elaims to the emperor's favour: Sestius cos. suffect. in
nc. 23, Agrippa the victor ol Actium, and (though the identification
is less certain) L. Munatius Plancus, on whose proposal the title os
Augustus had been bestowed by the Senate in nc. 27. Similarly
Kiessling has pointed out that in Sen. de Clem. 1. 10, Pollio, Sallustius,
and Dellius, whose names stand at the head ol Odes 2. 1, 2, 3, are
ranked together as amongst the first os the leading citizens to reconcile
themselves to Octavianus.

516. The arrangement ol the Epodes prepares us to expect that
melre would have some infiuence in the placing ol the Odes. A nega·
tive influence it evidently has, srorn the care with which he avoids the
juxtaposition ot two Odes ol the same metre. In the great instance
to the contrary (3. 1-6) the obvious purpose gives the greater signifi-
cance to his usual practice. Asa positive motive sor placing particular
Odes the principle has less scope, but we cannot but notice that in
B.i the first nine Odes furnish specimens os nine out ol the eleven
metres sound in the three Books one ol the two exceptions being
made up in Ode 11. The alternation olSapphies andAlcaics through
more than halt os B. ii seems another instance. ’

ξ 17. As with metre so with subject and tone, the great aim in the
arrangement seems to be variety. The key is to be changed as osten
