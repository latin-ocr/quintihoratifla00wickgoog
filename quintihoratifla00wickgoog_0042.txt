ODES, BOOKS 1-111. 23

From the Epitome oi Livy (B. 135) it appears that Crassus was
again fighting in Thrace in nc. 25.

Florus (4. 12, § 18) speaks os Lentulus driving the Daci beyond
the Danube, but no date is given. His words may be worth quoting
sor his mention ol Cotiso (Od. 3. 8. 18) and lor the illustration oi
Horace’s expression ‘intra praescriptum equitare* Od. a. 9. 23:
‘Daci montibus inhaerent 3 Cotisonis¹ regis imperio quotiens concretus
gelu Danuvius iunxerat ripas decurrere solebant et vicina populari.
Visum est Caesari Augusto gentem aditu difficillimam submovere.
Misso igitur Lentulo ultra ulteriorem repulit ripam: citra praesidia
constituit, sic tunc Dacia non victa sed submota atque dilata est.
Sarmatae patentibus campis inequitant ; et hos per eundem Lentulum
prohibere Danuvio satis luit.

It is obvious that there is nothing here to fix the date of the
debated Ode 3. 8. The victory os Crassus will satissy the expres·
sions oi v. 18, and so would the victory oi Lentulus, but this last is
itselfundated.

The Eastern Scythians are named by Justinus as interfering in the
quarrel between Phraates and Tiridates in Parthia (see the next
section). An embassy ol Scythians is said by Orosius (see lutrod. to
Od. a. 11) to have come to Augustus while he was at Tarraco in
spamae. 25.

58. Parthia—The defeats oi Roman armies under Crassus, Decidius
Saxa (the legatus ol M. Antony), and M. Antony himself, in ac. 53, 40,
and 36, though the objects oi frequent reference in Horace‘s poems‚
and grounds oi the keen interest taken in Parthian affairs, and os the
stress laid on the mission of Augustus to restore Roman prestige in
the East, yet all sall without the period assigned ior the composition
of the Odes. The only contemporaneous event oi Parthian history
is that which is related by Dion 51. 18, and by Justinus 42. 5. 5.
Phraates IV, to whom Orodes I had resigned his throne in ac. 38,
after some years of tyranny, provoked his subjects to the point ol
rebellion. He was expelled, and Tiridates, another member oi the
llrsacid house, though his exact relationship to Phraates is unknown,
was put on the throne in his place. Alter a short time Phraates was
restored (Justinus adds, by the intervention of the Scythians), and
Tiridates iled to seek the protection oi Augustus, carrying with him

¹Suetonius, Oct.63. calls him ‘Ge· one time promised Julia in marriage
tarum rex,’ and gives a story, on An· to him, and asked a daughter oi hia
