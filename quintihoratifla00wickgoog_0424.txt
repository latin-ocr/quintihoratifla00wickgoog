IN THE ODES. 405

existence, both by the persona! feelings that seem to accompany its
mention and by its recurrence among the reminiscences oi the poet's
own lise in the Epistles. That a mere literary reminiscence, an echo
of his amatory poems rather than os his feelings, is intended seems
uniikely in the absence oi the name from all his early poems.

What has been said will obviously not apply with equal force to
the EpodeS‚ where, in idea at least, personality is the essence of the
poem. The introduction oi Horaee's own name, as in Epod. r5, and
the pursuance oi his attach upon Canidia through three Epodes and
three Satires seem to indicate real and definite objects. But the
use of poetical names ior characters who baveno existence save at
the moment begins douthess in the Epodes‚ aa do other features

oi the Odes.
