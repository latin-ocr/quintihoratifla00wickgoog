126 HOerTl CARMINUM

Ο DE XXXVII.

A sorte ol triumphwrltten when the news reached Rome, in september, uc. 30,
ol the death ol Cleopatra and Antony (Dion 51. 19). Compare Epod. 9. which
celebrates their defeat at Actium in the preceding year. We may note the absence
from both Ode and Epode (ace esp. on v. 13) ol the name ol Antonius. Octavianus
has conquered not a Roman rival, but aloreign enemy: ‘Seruatus Cleopatrae non
Antonio bellum indixerat (Dion 50. 6): de illa triumphurn non de hoc decrevit
(Dion 51. 19).’ Ritter.

‘Now is the time sor merriruent and thankngiving, private and public; now, and
not before, while the great queen was plotting wild schemes ol destruction against
Rome. Her madneas was cooled at the sight ol her lieet in flames. Blind patric
becarm reasonable terror when she tled belore Caesar aaa dove belore a hawlr.
Yet she was no vulgar woman. She could brave out her fortune, and loolr death
in the sace rather than adorn a Roman triumph! Aa Horace paints the fierce
barbaric queen, her reclrlessness and her fortitude, he is bringing out in atronger
relies the danger honr which Rome has been lreed, and the glory ol Octavianus,
who has conquered no unworthy loe.

1 have notioed (introduction to·0des i—iii. 5 13) the important place assigned to
this Ode, at the end ol the Book. lt gives Horace's oecond ground lor aequieaciug
iu the supremacy ol Octavianus. The alternative, as time went on, had been seen
to be not a restoration ol the Republicau constitution as Brutus conceived it, but (as
achoioe ol masters) Antony with Cleopatra andan orientalized court. See also
additional note to Od 3. 3.

The opening ol the Ode was doubtleas modelled on the Ode ol Alcaeus upon the
death oi Myrsilus (Fr. ao, Bergk), ol which we have two lines preserved in Athen.
