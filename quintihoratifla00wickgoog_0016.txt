PREFACE. ix

so conscious and elaborate as in Horace's lyrics‚ it
is not too much to expect that we should be able
to detect the threads which bind them into their
several unities. lf my efforts teach a young reader
that he has not read a poem properly unless he has
attempted to do this sor himself, if they make him
less ready to admit in any poet, and especially in
Horace, the existence os ‘inert' epithets, and pur·
poseless digressions or amplifications, Ι shall not
complain that he should corne to trust for the ex-
planation of his difficulties to his own imagination
rather than to mine.

Some account of the materials at our disposal sor
the settlement os the text of Horace, and of the prin·
ciples on which Ι have endeavoured, where it was
necessary to do so, to exercise my own judgement,
will be sound in the General Introduction.

l have to acknowledge much kind help and many
usesul hints srom friends, especially srom A. Ο.
Prickard‚ Esq., Fellow and Tutor of New College,

who has been always ready with suggestive criticism‚ .

and to whom l was indebted sor special assistance
in writing the notes on the Fourth Book of the Odes.
l owe also to his labour, as well as to the kind

courtesy os the Provost and Fellows os Queen’s Col-
lege‚ the collation os the valuable Queen’s College
MS. which appears in an Appendix to this volume.
