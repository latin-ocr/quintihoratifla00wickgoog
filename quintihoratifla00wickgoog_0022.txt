TO THE ODES.

I. MSS.

r. Blandinzias Vetustrisziuus(‘V’). Cruquius,a professor at Bruges,
in making preparations for his edition¹, had had access to four MSS.

then extant in the Benedictine abbey of St. Peter ‘in monte Blandinio’
(Blanhenberg) near Ghent. These'MSS. all perished (as he tells us

in a note on the inscription to Book l ol the Satires) in the sack of
the abbey by a mob of iconoclasts in 1566. His own estimate put
them all as early as the ninth century, and one whose loss he especially
lamenta he distinguishes from the rest as ‘vetustissimus’ The
readings which he cites from this constitute the famous V, round'
. which so much ol the criticism on Horace’s text has turned.

The general opinion of editors, from Bentley downwards, has
attached very high value to these readings. Keller and Holder, on
the other hand, consistently undervalue them, placing the MS. among
the more interpolated, and even suggesting that some of the better
readings attributed to it were from Cruquius' own conjecture. Their
treatment of the question has led to its careiul reexamination by
several scholare. Perhaps the lullest and most judicial discussion oi
it is that by R. C. Kukula ¹. While maintaining the good faith of
Cruquius and the general value of the MS, he draws attention to
some important limitations to our use of his testimony. He points
out (r) that as the MSS. perished before any part of the edition
except Odes IV was published, what we have to imagine is in the
main notan edition prepared with the ‘vetustissimus' before him, to
be referred to again and again, but references to notes taken some
years before. (a) That to be of any value his quotation must be
distinctly given as from the ‘Bland vetustissimus' or from ‘omnes
Blandinii.’ He makes it clear that no argument can be drawn as to
its readings from his silence, or from any less definite descriptions such
as ‘tres Blaud.,' ‘unus Blaud.,' or even ‘codd Bland' (3) That the use
of his testimony must be stn'ctly confined to the particular point for
the sake of which his note shows that the reference is made, his
practice being evidently in other respects to quote from memory
or inexactly. A good instance occurs in Od. 4. 6. 28, where in the
edition of 1565 he apparently gives ‘Laetus Agyieu' as the reading
