dedicated the temple oi Apollo on the Palatius, to which was attached the famous
Libram, see Epp. 1. 3. ¹7· 1. 1. 217, 1. 1. 93, Suet. Oct. 29, Dion 53. 1. Pro
pertius gives an account oi the inauguration ol the temple, at which he had
himself been present. 3. ²3 ‘Quaeris cur veniam tibi tardiort Aurea Phaebo
Porticus a magno Caesare aperta init,' &c

‘ What special boon shall his poet asli ol Apollo todayl Not wealth in coru·
lands or cattle, not gold and ivery, not rineyards in Campania. He euvies neither
those who gron the rich wines nor the trader who at the eost oi so much risk
buys and drinks them. Content with humble iare, all he aslis is the power to
enjoy bealth oi body and oi mind too now, and an old age not wanting either iu
honour or in tbe pleasure os poetry.‘
