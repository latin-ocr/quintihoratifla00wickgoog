ODE XVIII.

A us'strt to Faunus: cp. 1. 17. 1-8. Horace prays that the visits of the god to
his lands may be kindly‚ and promises that the due kid and wine and incense shall
be offered at the Faunalia on tha nones of December, the holidny of cattle and of
villagers, the day of peace, when even the wolf strays harmiessly among the Iambs;
when the trees shed their leaves to strew Faunus' path, and the ditcher revenges
himself on the ground which has worked him so hard, by danciug on it.
