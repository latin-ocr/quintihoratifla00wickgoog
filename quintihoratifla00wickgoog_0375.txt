HORATI EPODON

EPODE 11.

Honncn glres a point to his praises oi country liie by putting them into the
mouth oi a money-lendes notorious lor his keenness in his trade. Cp. the saying
attributed apparently to tlre same person, the ⁴ fenerator Alfiue’ by Columella (r. 7)
‘vel optima nomina non appellando fieri mala,’ ‘that the best debtors become bed
ones ii you let them alone.' There does not seem to be aoy attempt to make the
nsurer speek in character through the poem 3 the pleasures named are those which
any Roman poet would have named (cp. Virg. G. 2. 493 soll, Tibull. 1. 1 soll),
and they are no doubt such as Horace ieels himself. The irony ol the conclusion
(⁶ so the most unlilrely people say, although their acts again give the lie to it ’)‚ es
Sellar points out, is like the ironical conclusion oi so many Odes: Horace will not
prese too hurd enen his praises oi country lile: but the character ot' the ironyis
due to the nature oi the poem 3 it tums an Idyll into sn Epode. Its point is rather
the strength oi the ‘ruling passiou' (cp. the ‘mercator’ ol Od. r. 1. 16, who in
· the storm ‘otium et oppidi Laudat rura sui: mox reiicit rates Quassus ') thunre
hus been suggested, the elaborate hypocrisy oi a money-lenden who males hir
panegyric on a rustic life au excuse ior pressing his debtors sor repayment‚ while
he means all the while to put the money out to interest again at the next settle·
ment-day.

The diction ol the Epode reminds ns constantly oi the Georgius.

BEATUS ille, qui procul negotiis,
Ut prisca gens mortalium,
Paterna rura bobus exercet suiS,
Solutus omni fenore,
Neque excitatur classico miles truci,
Neque horret iratum mare,
Forumque vitat et superba civium
Potentiorum limina.
