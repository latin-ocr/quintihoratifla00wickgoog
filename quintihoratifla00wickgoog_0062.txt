ODE ΙΙΙ.

‘O stttv, in which Virgil ir salling to Greece, carry thy precioua burden safely.
lt is a dreadful n'alr, the sea. He was a hard, bold man who frrrt ventured upon
ir. The goda meant lt to be a barrier impassable, but man delightr in disobe-
dience. Prometheus brought frre on earth aud sickness with it. Daedalus tried
to fly. Acheron was no barrier to Herculea. Where shall we stop? and when
will Jove be ableto lay auide his holts of wrath i'

This Ode has been often referred to the voyage of Virgil to Athena, from which
he returned only to die in Β. c. 19. This, however, would fir its composition four
years later than the date which on other grounds we assign to the publication of
Books i-iii; nor is it au Ode which is likely to have been inserted efter publication.
Given to the world in Virgil’s lifetime, it is playful and affectionate, but it would
seem cold and irrelevant to be published after hia early death, and in a volume in
which it was thetole record of their friendship. Franlre felt the difficulty so much
that he proposed to read ‘Quintilium' for ‘Vergilium,’ thinking that he could truce
a coneepondence between this Ode and i. 24, especially in v. rr ‘heu nonita credi-
tum.’ It has even been suggested that it may have been another Vergilius, as is the
case no doubt with our, ta. The simplest solution is that the reference is to
another voyage. All we lrnow even of the voyage in tac. 19 is due to the frag·
mentary biography which goes by the name of Donatus, and which is not supposed
to be earlier than the fifth century.

lt ia one of the many instaures of Horace’s oareful placing of his Odes that the
Ode placed next to those which express his devotion to Maecenas and to Caesar
should be one that hears the name of the friend to whose introduction (Sat. 1. 6. 54)
he owed his acquaintance with the former, and therefore with the latter-the author
of his fortunes aud hia literary ideal
