200 HORATI CARMINUM

iu reassuriug Roman patriota on this point: the revival and glorificatiou oi Rome, ’
not its displaoemeut,is the idea oi the empire. lt will be seen that apert irum thia
Ode the evidence is very slight that any such political idea was practically before
men's minda: aud when we read the Ode itseli the theory iniis ιο account ior all
the luctu lt does not explain the emphasis laid throughout ou the moral charac-
teristica oi Troy, nor give the connexion which there should be between the story
and the earlier part ol ὼε Ode.

It had been already pointed out that oue lrey ιο the Epiaode is louud iu the lact
mentioued by Dion (53. 1⁶), Suetonius (Oct. 7), aud Florus (a. 34), that when
Octauianus took the title oi Augustus it had been in contemplation (according to
some accounts it had been his own desire) that he should be called Romulus, as the
aecmd 1⁴* onuder oi the Roman atate. This must certainly be in Horaoe’s mind. lt
explains why Romulae is (v. 1⁵) the climax oi the instances oi immortality won by
labours iu the cause ol cirilimtiour ‘Yes,' he says, ‘ Augustus isaaecond Romulus,
only the second Founder will remember the lessou set to the first Fouuder-Rome
was to be Rome, not a second Troy!

Pliias aud those who follow him see iu this warning an allegorical picture ol the
danger ol returnlng, ‘nimium pii,’ to the political ideals oi the Republic. It nmy
be doubted whether Horace or his master would hare wished to draw such a sharp
line aa this implica between the constitution before and aiter the beginning oi the
principate. Augustus ls set iorth iu these Odes as the restorer oi the old rather than
as the lonuder oi a new order ol things But probably the dangers oi which the
poet spealrs are not, primarily, political. It must be remembcred that the words
are put luto Jnno'a mouth uot in the middle, but at the commencement oi Roman
history. They are the imagined charter ol its grcatuesa—recalled now, doubtless
ior a special raason, beorum there was or had been a special rislr oi its infringe·
ment The resemblance cannot be accidental between thia Ode aud the stannus ol
the Carmen Saeculare iu which (vv. 37-48) the same close relation aud emential
diilerence between Troy and Rome are dwelt upon: Rome represents not the whole
οἱ Troy, but the ‘remnant,' the descendants and imitators oi the ‘c'astns Aeneas,
patriae superstes! Rome, Horace would say, has had its long career os greatness
because the condition has been complied with τ the old vices, ‘Laomedonteae
periuria Troiae,' Asiutic perfidy, luxury, greed ol treasure, have uot broken out again.
Why does he say so at this momenti The most lilrely answer seems to be that he
is thinking, iu part at any rate, ol the rival rlgr'me from which Angustus has saved
theru. lt isa thought ou which we know that he dwelt‚ the orientalr'sr'ng ol the
Roman empire which uas threatened il the victory at Actium had fallen ιο Autouy
and the ‘mulier peregrina ¹ ’. The six Odea would lali to set out all the grounds
on which Horace accepted memte oiAngnstus and recommended it ιο his country-
rnen it' this oue was altogether omitted.
