a lyric), throwr some real uncertainy over the idea oi the poem Archytas was
a Pythagorean philosopher who lived at Tarentum in the fourth century 110.
Nothing is known ol the place olbis death and burial. The Ode seems to imply
that he had a tomb on the sea-coast which Horace calls (v. 3) ‘litus Matinum'
The locality oi this is uncertain. Some have placed lt near Tarentum on the
ground that Archytas belonged to that place, and that the dead man appeals to
‘Neptune the guardian oi Τ arentum? The Ode would then bedae to some
incident or association which Horace came upon in one ol his visits to Tarentum
(Οά. a. 6. 9 soll). But the arguments are stronger ior placing it near the Prom.
Garganum in Apulia, near Horace's own country. The naute occurs only in
Horace (here and in Od. 4. a. 27 ‘Ego apis Matinae more modoque‚' aad Epod.
16. 28 ‘quando Padus Matina laverit cacumina ’y and in Lucan Phars. 9. 185 where
the ‘buxeta Matini’ are ranked with ⁴ Garganus' and Mount Vultur as belonging
to Apulia, A village at the base oi the promontory oi Garganum is now called
‘Mattinata' It ls also noticed that the ‘woodo oi Venusia' (v. 16) are near
enough to stand ior ⁴ the inland woods' ii the soene is laid near the mouth oi the
Aufidus, hut would not occur naturally ii the speaker was at Tarentum.

We may notice that Horace seems to hare been interested in the Pythagorean
doctrines, and especially in that oi Metempsychosis, and yet not disinclined to
speak playfully ol tham, Epod. 15. 21, S. a. 6. 61, Epp. a. 1. 51. He ranks
Pythagoras with Socrates and Plato as representing the great teachers oi Greek
philosophy, S. a. 4. 3.
