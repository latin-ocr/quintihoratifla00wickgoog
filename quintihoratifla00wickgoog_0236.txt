ODE Vll.

the spring aud bring a wealth οἰ Bithynian merchandite. He will come back:
he is only detained by the winter in the harbour to which he was driven on his
way home. He lies awalre at night thinking oi you. 1t is all invain that his
hostess Chlo'e' tries every art to win him, sende emissaries to teli him οἱ her
passion and to prove to him from mythology the iolly oi mastancy; he tums
