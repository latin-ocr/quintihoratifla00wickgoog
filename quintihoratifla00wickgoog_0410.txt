EPODE XVl.

‘A secono generation is passing away in civil war. Roman hands are doing
what no ineman, in Italy or beyond it, has been able to do. The site oi Rome
will be once more desolate; barbarian conquerors will ride over it, and scatter
with their horse-bools the bones oi Romulus. Do yon asir the remedyi [et ns
fly lilre the Phocaeam-leave hearth and home, and fly-anywhere; only never to
corne back again till stone rwims and every law oi nature is changed. tet us ull
go-all, or all that have men's hearts in them. We shall find a home beyond the
Ocean. There are the Happy islanda, where the earth yields its irnit without
labonr, where the powers oi nature never injure, where commerce has never come
to taint man, nor pingue to taint cattle. Jove set them apart ior the good when he
tnmed the golden nge to bronze—to bronze and then to iron. It is time lor those
who are good to seek the offered reinge'

See Introd. to Epod. 7. The two poems belong to the same phase oi feeling.
They may have been written at any time when Horace had begun to sichen oi the
aimless bloodshed oi the civil war, and before he had seen or reconciled himself to
the practical remedy which Octavianus offered ior it. At present the suggestion
oi a mode ol escape from it is not more than a poetical mode oi expressing its
hopelessness. He cannot see its issue, any more than in Epod. yhe can see its
canses.

The Pseudo-Acron quotes from alost work oi Sallust, to the effect that Sertorius,
alter his deleat, thought oi sailing into the Atlantis in search oi the labled islands
oi the blest, ‘cd insulas Fortunatas voluisse ire! The genuineness oi the quotation
is confirmed by Servius, who, on Virg. Aen. 5. 735, refers to Sallust as having
spoken oi the μακάρων νῆσοι. Plutarch tells the earne story in the liic os Sertorius,
· ch. 9. It is very possible that Horace may have heard it, and that it may have
suggested the conclusion oi the Epode.

Compare the description oi the Happy Isiands both in thought and expression
with Virgil’s Golden Age in Ecl. 4.
