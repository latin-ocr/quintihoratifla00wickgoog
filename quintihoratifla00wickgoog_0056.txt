LIB. Ι. OD. 1.

Multos castra iuvant et lituo tubae
Permixtus sonitus bellaque matribus
Detestata. Manet suh Iove frigido
Venator tenerae coniugis immemor,

Seu rupit teretes Marsus aper plagas.
Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium
Dis miscent superis, me gelidum nemus 30
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori
Secernunt populo, si neque tibias
Euterpe cohibet nec Polyhymnia
Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.
