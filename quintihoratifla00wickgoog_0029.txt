10 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

a. To the constructive criticism of previous centuries was added in
the present one the destructive criticism of which the chief examples
arcto be found in the edition of H. Peerlkamp (Heriem, 18543
Amsterdam, 1862) and in the work of Gruppe, Minos: iiber die
Interpolationen in den riimischen Dichtern, Leipzig, 1859. This,
like the former, proposes to carry us back beyond the age 01 MSS. or
Scholia: unlike the former, it cannot even appeal to indicatione of
disturbance in the MSS. which would explain, if they did not require,
its theories. The antecedent probability of defects in the archetype
wrongly filled up cannot be denied in the face of evidence that such
defects must actually have existed: it becomes a question 01 1033 or
more. But the antecedent probability of the suppositions which are
necessary to any theory of the interpolation of spurious Odes or parts
of Odes cannot be so easily granted Every known fact in the history
01 Horace’s poems can be explained without such a theory, unless
indeed it be assumed that no poem or stanza which falls below his
highest poetical level can be genuine. On the other hand, as
Mnnro pointed out ¹, in his vigorous summary of the arguments
against the interpolation theory, the fhrm of Horace's poems is
specially his own. We are asked to imagine that unknown poets,

' in the literary age of Rome, reproduced it with a skill and complete·

ness of which the known poets who have tried to imitate it proved
themselves incapable. But though Peerlkamp's method 01 criticism
must be pronounced baseless, we may trace from it, as from its pre·
decessor, indirect results of value in the attention which it calls to the
sequence 01 thought, the lights and shades of style, and the varying
merit of the poetry.

11. The Scholiasls.

Tus collectione 01 Scholia on Horace which pass under the names
of Helenius Acron, and Pomponius Porphyrion, can neither 01 them
be certainly dated, and some doubt therefore hangs over their relation
to one another3 neither 01 them is in a perfect state nor free from
suspicion of interpolatione. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, they
must be considered of very high value. On questions of text the
authority 01 the commentary is at the least several centurics older than
any MS. of the poet, either extant or known to us by testimony. Of
course the ‘lemmata' or quoted words, to which the comment is
affixed, are of inferior importance, and they difier not unfrequently
