HORATl CARMINUM

ODE Vll.

‘ Trrn world is lull os seir spots, but your own Tibur ls the seirent Forget your
troubles, Plancus; ln camp, or here in Tibur, droun cure in wine. Remember
how Teucer put 2 bold lnce on hir culumity, und found ι new &lamis to make up
t'or the old!

Whut Plancus' trouble was we do not know, nor whether it bore sny resem-
blsuoe to Teucer's by involving u compulsory absence from his well-loved Tibur.

The Scholiasts identiiy Plancus with the L Munatius Plancus who was consul in
nc. 42 (Οά. 3. 14. 28 ‘consule Pluuco'). He was u politicien who hed changed
sides serersl times iu the civil war. Many stories to his discredit sue told by
Velleius Paterculns, who cells him ‘morbo proditor! He hsd reconciled himself
to Octavianus, und it was ou his proponl thet the title oi Augustus was oonierred
upon him iu nc. 27. munim, the placeoithe Odehss the nme signifioeuoe

With the story ol Teucer st the end ol the Ode compare the conclusion oi
Epod. 13. ιι cd fin.

Several of the best Mss begin a new Ode et v. ι 5. The division wes ss old ss

esse, sed eadem est; nem et hic sd Plancum loquitur ouius in honorem etin supe·
riore perte Tibur laudavit, Plancus euim inde init oriundus? There seems too
little substance iu the first lourteen lines ior s seperate Ode, end the recurrenoe to
Tibur in v. ao is clearly the link, though u slight one. Mistakes iu the mutter ure
common in the MSS. See Epod. 2, ²3 end 9²7. Porphmeutions und condemns
u division oi Od. 3. 24 ιι v. 25, though it isnot so iound in sny extent MS. The
opposite mistuke occurs in Od. 2. ι4, 15, which ure written contiunously in several
oi the oldest MSS. , although there is no conceivable connexion between them.
