LIB. 11. OD. 19.

ODE XIX.

ΤΗΒ poet imagines himself (vv. 1-4) to have come, while wandering in the hills‚
on Bacchus amidst the Nympha and Satyrs. He describes dramatically (as though
he felt them at the moment) the effecte oi the sight: the fresh terror (χαλεποὶ hl
Oroi φαίνεσθαι lmpyrir, Hom. ll. ao. 131), the ruah oi inspiration3 delightinl‚ yet
hali panici, from its tumultnoua excitement. Thea he finds the way oi relies.
He may sing the praires oi Bacchns; oi his power to blesa those whom he loved
and destroy his enemies; his power over inanimate nature, over noxious beasts,
over the giants, over the monsters oi Hades.

Compare Od. 3. 25. They both reem to be attempta to catch something os the
inspiration of a Greek dithyramh. That Ode has a purpose; the present one is
a mere stndy. There is no reason to believe that it is a reproduerion oi any single

Ι original. The art oi its composition, the climax through which the celebration ol

Bacchns’ triumph rises, and the studiedly quiet conclusion alter the abrupt bursis
ot' the beginning, as though the strained mind had found relies and the ‘turbida
laetitia’ run itseli clear, are Horatian rather than Greek.

Dillr. suggests that Horace had been lately reading Euripides' Bacchae. That
he had read it is pretty certain.
