LIBER. EPOD. 5.

Senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum

Latrent Suburanae canes
Nardo perunctum, quale non perfectius

Meae laborarint manua— 60
Quid accidit? Cur dira barbarae minus

Venena Medeae valent?

Quibus superbam fugit ulta paelicem,
Magni Creontis filiam,
Cum palla, tabo munus imbutum, novam ⁶5
Incendio nuptam abstulit.
Atqui nec herba nec latens in asperis
Radix fefellit me locis.
Indormit unctis omnium cubilibus
Oblivione paelicum.—
A! al solutus ambulat veneticae
Scientioris carmine.
