INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV.

Titana is no reason to doubt the account given by Suetonius
of the origin oi this Book. The occasion and general date oi it are
lixed clearly on its own evidence. With the exception of Ode 6,
which is manifestly written at the same time as the Carmen Saeculare,
ie. in rac. 17, all the Odes that can be dated reler immediately to
two events, viz. (ι) the return of Augustus to Rome in rac. 13, alter .
three years' absence in Gaul, whither he had gone in the year 16, on
the news ol the defeat ol Lollius by the Sygambri; (a) the double
campaign ol Drusus and Tiberius in Raetia and Vindelicia, which
occupied the year 15.

Marcellus ; the military triumphs and the moral and social resorms
which in the earlier Books were prophecy, are now history; the
Cantabrian, ‘non ante domabilis,' is no longer a cause os disquiet;
the Parthians have restored the standards ol Carrhae, and Phraates and
his quarrels are sorgotten 3 the vague alarms about the Daciam or
projects oi conquest in Britain, have given place to real dangers met
on the Rhine, and substantial victories won in the Bastern Alps. The
position oi one name in the Book marks more clearly still the contrast
between the two epochs, both in respect oi the outer world and oi
Horace’s own life. Maecenas, whom even in rac. ¹9 he addressed as
‘prima dicte mihi summa dicende camena,' is mentioned but once in
this Book. His birthday is the occasion os Ode 11, and he is spoken
of in terms ol the old affection ς but (ι) we have no hint now os his
