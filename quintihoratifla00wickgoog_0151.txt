132 HORATI CARMINUM

Cui laurus aeternos honores
Delmatico peperit triumpho.
lam nunc minaci murmure cornuum
Perstringis aures, iarn litui strepunt,

Terret equos equitumque vultus.
Audire magnos iam videor duces
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos,
Et cuncta terrarum subacta
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.
Iuno et deorum quisquis amicior
Afris inulta cesserat impotens
