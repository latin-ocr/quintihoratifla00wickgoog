HORATI EPODON

Tibi hospitale pectus et purae manus,
Tuusque venter Pactumeius, et tuo
Cruore rubros obstetrix pannos lavit,
Utcumque sortis exilis puerpera.

Quid obseratis auribus fundis preces?
Non saxa nudis surdiora navitis
Neptunus alto tundit hibernus salo. ‚
Inultus ut tu riseris Cotyttia
Vulgata, sacrum liberi Cupidinis,

Et Esquilini pontifex venefici

Impune ut Urbem nomine impleris meo?

Quid proderat ditasse Pelignus anus, to
Velociusve miscuisse toxicum?
