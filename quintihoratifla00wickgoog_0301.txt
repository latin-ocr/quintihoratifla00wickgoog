(Anu. 1. ro). At any rate it was sufficient to make Augustus set out
in person from Rome. Before, however, he reached the frontier, the
Sygambri, finding that Lollius was rallying bis forces, and that rein·
iorcements were on their way from Rome, made a hasty peace, and
retired again beyond the Rhine. See Dion 54. ao. Augustus remained
in Gaul during the whole 01 the two following years, and did not retum

a. ln the meantime, in the year 15, an important and permanent ,
conquest had been effected by Tiberius and Drusus, the sons 01 Livia
by her iormer husband Ti. Claudius Ner0. Merivale recounts (vol. iv,
ch. 34, p. 142) the operations by which secure possession was gained
by Rome in Augustus' reign 01 the western passes 01 the Alps, the
Comiche Road, the passes that lead irom France to Turin, and the
St Bemard passes into the Val d' Aosta. The work ol Tiberius and
Drusus was directed to the similar object 01 obtaining military command
01 the more eastern passes into the valleys 01 the Rhine and the Inn,
which were still unsafe lor the armies of Rome or her allies, and from
which the mountain-tribes even issued irom time to time to plunder
Italian soil. Drusus forced what is now known as the Brenner pass,
meeting and overthrowing the Rhaetians in the valley near Tridentum,
now Trent. ln the meantime, or as soon as Drusus' success was
assured, Tiberius was detached from Augustus’ army in Gaul, with
the purpose 01 taking the enemy in the rear. He ascended the
Rhine valley to the Lake ol Constance, where he launched a flotilla
01 boats, and entering at once several 01 the valleys which open on the
lake, ‘penetrated the gorges 01 the Upper Rhine and lnn in every
direction, so that at the conclusion of a brilliant and rapid campaign,
the two brothers had effected the complete subjugation 01 the country
01 the Grisons and the Tyrol! ‘The free tribes oi the Eastem Alps
