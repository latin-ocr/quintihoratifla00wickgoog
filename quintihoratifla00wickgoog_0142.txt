must have a white atone to mark it. We will revel, we will dance: Bassus shall

Nothing iaknown ot' Numida. Act. and Porph. call him ‘Pomponius Numida,’
the Comm. Cruq. ‘Plotius' The latter is more likely to he right, as Numida is
a imm cognomen oi the Plautia or Plotia gens. It is usually supposed that
he was retnruing hom the Cantabrian war, from which Augustus returned iu
