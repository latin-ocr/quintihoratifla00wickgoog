CARMEN SAECULARE. 339

Games under Augustus and under Septimius Severus. These frag-
ments bave been pieced together, and are now to be seen in the
Museo Nazionale hythe Baths oi Diocletian ¹.

According to this inscription the games oi uc. 17 took place on the
rst oi June and two following days. The sacrifices described in it as
offered by the Emperor and by Agrippa, who is associated with him
throughout, are-

1. On three successive nr'ghls, ‘in campo ad T iberim!
1. To the Moerae, an offering ol ewe-lambs and goats.

a. To the ilithyiae, an offering oi cakes (‘ popana,' cp. Juv. 6. 54 ι,
‘liba’ ‘phthoides ’).

3. To Terra mater.

11. On three successive days

1. On the Capitoline to ‘luppiter optimus maximus‚’ an offering
oi two ‘boves mares!

a. Also on the Capitoline to Juno, two ‘boves feminae!

3. On the Palatine to Apollo and Diana, an offering of cakes, us
in the case oi the Ilithyiae.

On the last day it is added, ‘sacrificioque perfecto pueri xxvrr quibus
denuntiatum erat patrimi et matrimi et puellae totidem carmen ceci·
nerunt3 eodemque modo in Capitolio [words possibly lost] carmen
composuit Q. Horatius Flaccus?

It will be noticed that the list oi sacrifices omits those to Dis
and Proserpina, which are mentioned by Zosimus In this it is in
accord with Horace's Ode which knows nothing oi those deities. Dis
and Proserpina were, according to Censorinus, the deities to whom the
original ‘ludi Tarentini' were dedicated, but Augustus though liniring
his ‘ludi saeculares' to these in respect os place and much oi the
ceremonial, gave them a new turn, substituting in the nightly sacrifices
the more beneficentior the darker oi the Chthonian Powers, the
Moerae Ilithyiae and Demeter ior Dis and Proserpina, and adding the
sacrifices by day to the greater deities, the place oi honour being
given to Apollo and Diana.
