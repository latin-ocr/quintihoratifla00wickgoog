ADDITIONAL NOTE

It may be taken for granted that some serious purpose, genusne to the general
subject of the six Odes, underlies the denunciation of Troy and of its rebuilding,
which forms such a large part of this Ode. It is lile the myth of a Pindarie Ode,
never unconnected with the personal occasion or with the gnomic introductiou, and
itis evidently parallel to the ‘gigantomachia’ of Ode4 aud to the Regulus-story of
Ode 5, both of which havea bearing on the subjectwhich none can mistake. What
the purpose isin this oase cannot be explained as certainly.

Many editors have recalled the story preserved by Suetonius (Jul. 79) that
among the causes of the Dictator's unpopularity was a rumour ‘ migraturum Alex·
andriam vel Ilium translatis simul opibus imperii, exhaustaque Italia delectibus, et
procuratione urbium amicis permissa! Mommsen lends the weight of his authority
to the view that Horace is referring, not indeed to any such speeific rumour, but to
a feeling, already in the air ¹, that the extension and consolidatlon of the empire
would lead, as it actually led in the end, to the transference of the centre of gravity
to the eastern end of the Meditenanean. He is expressing the mind of Augustus

time, Livy dwellsly. 24) that it was proposed in the time of Camillus to remove the seat of
