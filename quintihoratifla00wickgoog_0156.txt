ODE ΙΙΙ.

‘Lsr the thought of death moderate both repining iu trouble aud exultation iu
prosperity. Enjoy yourself while you may, for death is at hand, for rich and noble
as well ss for poor and humbly born?

Some little doubt heugs orer the name of the person to whom these couusels
of Epicureanism are addressed. The old Blandinieu MS. gave it es ‘Gellius’
Cruquius identifies him with L. Gellius Publicola, the brother (half brother
through their mother Polla, or brother by adoption, according to different theories)
of Messalla (Od. 3. ar, 7), and consul tte. 36.

Dellius (as the other good MSS. and the Mss, of Acr. end Porph. write the
name) would no doubt be Q. Dellius, who bed changed sides so often that Messalla
is said to have uiclsnamed him ‘Desultor bellorum civilium' Kiessliug points out
that Seneca (de Clem. 1. ιο) reulus him with Sallustius as among the first to recou-
cile themselves to Augustus.

It is worth notiug, as an illustratiou of Horace's way of placing his poems, that
this Epicurean Ode follows the Stoicism of the preceding one, just as the Epp. r. 16,
iu which he preaches Stoic morality, stands between 1. 15, in which lre likens
himself to the Epicurean Maenius, and 1. 17, in which he gives cynical advice to
Scaeva. Cp. tbe sequence of the tenth and eleventh Odes of this book.
