Julus Antonius was the sou of the Triumvir by Fulvia, and was educated by his
step-mother Octavia. 'l'hrough her protection he was spared when his brother
Marcus Antyllus was siaiu, and rose eventually to high favour with Angustus, and
was married to Marcella, Octavia's daughter, aller her divoroe from Agrippa in
ne. 21. Horace's Ode is the only ancient authority for his having been a p0et;
but the PsendoAcron vouches for his having written an excellent Epic poem in
twelve Books. called the Diomedeia, some years afterwards He was made praetor
in rac. 13, and consul in nc. 10. ln n.c.a he was condemned to death on the
charge of adulterous intercourse with Julia.

On the bearing of the Ode in its place see Introd. p. 280. The exact date of
composition is less certain. lt may have been written in the year of Augustns’
return (ne. 13) or in anticipation of it at any time after the submission of the
Sygambri (p. 282). Frauke thinks, that the omission of reference to the successes
of Tiberius and Dmsus makes it improbable that it was written after the year 15;
others see in v. 49 (see note) a reference to the Praetorship of Antonius, i. e. to
a.c.13.

With the form of the Ode, refusing praise in word, yet granting it in the act of
refusal both directly and indirectly, comp. ι. 6, and 1. 12.
