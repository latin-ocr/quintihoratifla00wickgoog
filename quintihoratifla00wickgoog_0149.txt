LIBER SECUNDUS.

ODE Ι.

‘Potito iswriting the tale of the civil wars, adifficult and delicate task. We
can afford to let even his tragedies wait awhile, till the great aud hrave orator of
the forum and the senate, and the conqueror of illyria. has given us his history.
lu our eagerness we seem already to hear the trumpets aud see the flushing amour,
to hear him reading to us of the fall of chieftaius and the conquest of all the world
save Cato's stubborn soul. Ay, Jugurtha is avenged now! What laudor sea
is not red with the blood of our fratricidal warsi But stay, my Muse, these are no
theutes for you.'

There is nothing to fix the date of the Ode. The expressions of the two first
stauzas, ‘nondum expiatis,' ‘cineri d010s0,’ attraet it to the Odes (such as 1. a and
ιι) which dwell more on the troubles from which the State had already escaped,
thau ou the new and peaeeful order on which it had entered. Octavianus is not
mentioned. Pollio had not sided with him, and had certainly been a friend of
M. Antony. But the Ode expresses, as strongly aa Od. 1. ι, that weariness of
bloodshed which had indueed men to acquiesce in the ruie of one.

C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and supporter of Julius Caesar, having passed
through the Consulship in tac. 40 (Virg. E. 4), and won the honours of a triumph
for his campaign against the Illyrians (ib. 8. 6—13), withdrew from public life, and,
iu the subsequent struggle between Antony and Octavius, remained honourably
neutral. He wasa magnifioent patron of literature, and is famous as having estab-
lished the first public library at Rome out of the spoils of his Illyriau campaign.
He was also one of the most accomplishetl men of the age. Catullus (ra. 9) speaks
of him in his youth as ‘leporum Disertus puer et facetiarum! lle is ranked among
the great orators by Quintilian (ro. 1. ιι 3), Seneca (Epist. roo), and Tacitus (De Or.
38). His tragedies are spoken of in high terius by Virgil (E. 8. ιο ‘solaSophocleo
tua earmina digna cothurno ¹) aud Horace (Sat. 1. to. 4²)· His history of the
civil ware, from inc. 60 to the establishment of Augustus’ power, is referred to by
'l'acitus (Anu. 4 34). Suetonius (Jul. 3ο).

We may notice the skill with which Pollio's various accomplishrnents are worked
incidentally into the Ode.
