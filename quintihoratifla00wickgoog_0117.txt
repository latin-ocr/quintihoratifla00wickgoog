98 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE XXVI.

‘Titu Muse's friend, Ι cau east sorrow and fears to the winda. The politica of
Scythia aud Parthia that trouble all the world are nothing to me. Help me, sweet
Mese, to weave a ehaplet of freshest lyric verse for my dear friend lamia)

It is difficolt to see the point of connexion between the first and last parts of the

’ Ode, unless. indeed, as has been suggested, Horace is holding up his own cheerfulness

and its source to Lamia's imitation, see Introd. to Od. 3. ry. If Epp. r. 14. 6 refer
to the same person as the tvo Odes, the trait there given, ‘rapto de fratre dolentis
insolabiliter: may confirm the idea that he was a person on whom sorrow sat
heavily.

Aelius Lamia, the school friend of Numida (od. 1. 36. 7) and the ‘vetusto
nobilis ab Lamo· of 3. 17. ι, is generally identified with L. Aelius Lamia who was
Praefectus urbi in no. 32, and died rau. 33. Tac Anu. 6. ay ‘genus illi decorum,
vivida suiectus! If this Ode therefore is to be dated before tac. ²3. he must hare
been quite a young man when it was written. Ritter, feeling this to be a diffimlty,
suggests that the lamia of the Odesis au elder brother of Lucius. The name of
a Q. Aelius Lamia, ‘triumvir monetalis,’ has been found ou a coin of this date.
He thinks that it is his deaththat Lucius is represented as lamenting in Epp. 1.
14. 6.

On the date of the Ode and the allusion of vv. 3-5 see introd. to Odes i-iii, ς 8.

ll'ith vv. 1-6 cp. Virg. G. a. 490-497. The friendship of the Muses gives to
Horace the freedom which Virgil attributes to philosophy and a country life.
