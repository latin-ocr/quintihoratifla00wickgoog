LIB. Ι. OD. 24.

QUIS desiderio sit pudor aut modus

Tam cari capitis? Praecipe lugubres

Cantus, Melpomene, cui liquidam pater
Vocem cum cithara dedit.

Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor

Urget! cui Pudor et Iustitiae soror,

Incorrupta Fides, nudaque Veritas
Quando ullum inveniet parem?

Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,

Nulli flebilior quam tibi, Vergili.

Tu frustra pius heu non ita creditum
Poscis Quintilium deos.

Quid si Thretcio blandius Orpheo
Auditam moderere arboribus fidem,
