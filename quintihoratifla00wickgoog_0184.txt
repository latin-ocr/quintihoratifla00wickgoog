LIB. 11. OD. 14.

ODE XIV.

‘Tur years ere flying, Postumus ; no pmyers will stay them; not three heca-
tombs a day will turn the heart oi Pluto the tearless, the almighty, who holds
Geryon fast, despite his three bodies, aud Tityos, behind the Styx, aye, the Styx,
which we must all oross alike, rich und poor. Yon may avoid ull common risks,
yet you must die. The treasures that you· heve boarded your wiser heir will
squunder?

The burdeu isthe same as thet os Od. π. 3 und 11, andos 4. y ‘lile is short, let
us enjoy it while we may'3 but there is more oi sudness in this Ode than iu the
others. The usual moral is hinted in the passing epithet ‘ dignior’ bestowed on the
heir who is to waste our store os choice wine; but the feeling ol the staura is not so
much ior his wisdom as sor the edditional bitterness which it adds to our lubours
to know thet they may be nil undone us soon as we are dead. ‘We must leave it
unto a man that shall be niter us, and who knoweth whether he shall be n wise
mun or a toolt' Eocles. α. 19. There is no clue to the person addressed. It hss
been suggested that he may be the Postumus to whom Propertius writes his Elegy
