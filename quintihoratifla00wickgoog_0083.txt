HORATl CARMINUM

ODE Xll.

‘wrm man wilt thou sing ol, Clio? what demigodl what god i-sing ot', till
the hill ot' Helicon riugs his name again, or the woods ol Haemus follow to listen,
as they did when Orpheus sang? What god, but Jove first, und Pallas next, Liber
Diana, Phoebus. For demigods, Hercules und the Twin Brethren who calm the
stormy sea. And ol meu: Romulus aud all the Roman worthies ; Marcellus, the
lustre of whose name grows with each generation; the Julian house, which out·
shiues all others as the moon outshines the stam Caesar, the hope ol the human
race, the vicegerent oi Jove himself.⁸

The iramevvorlr of the Ode is suggested by the opening ol Pind. Ol. 2 :-

lwtttleem‘s ὕμνοι
rivo θεόν, rlr' ἥρω, τίνα δ’ drdpu κελαδήσομενς

lt we compare this Ode with the Second it carries Horace's acceptance ol the Cae·
sarean regime a step further. That Ode welcomes it as the end ol civil war, this as
the crown ol Roman history. The place given to Marcellus in the climax suggests
a special occasion aud gives a limit ol date to the Ode, sec introd. to Odes i—iii.§ 2.
lt cannot have been written and can hardly have been published alter his untimely
death in the autumn ol nc. ²3· lt liuks his name too closely to theJulian house to
have been written before Augustus had given uumistnlreable procl ol his intentioris
towards him. lt is natural to think ol his betrothal aud marriage to Julia in
mc. ²5· See on v. 47.
