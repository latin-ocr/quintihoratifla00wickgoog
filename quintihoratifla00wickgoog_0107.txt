88 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE XXl.

Cottum Catull. 34 ‘Dianae sumus in fide,’ &a

Several occasions have been imagincd sor this Ode. The Pseudo-Aer. associated
it with the Ludi Saeculares, u.c.17, and it was accordingly treated by several
' editors as au lntroductiou to the Carnu. Sacc„

Franke ussigns it to tac. 28, the year in which Augustus dedicated the temple to
Apollo on the Palatius (Od. r. 31), und instituted the quinquennial Ludi Actiaci

in honour oi Apollo and Diana. He thinks the ode was written ior their first
celebration.

It is more probably an exercise oi lancy, suggested perhaps by some such occasion
as the games os s. c, 28. It is hardly oi weight enough to have been composed ior
public performance, and Horace was uot prominent enough at that date to have
been selected, as he was in rs. e. 17, to write such au Ode.
