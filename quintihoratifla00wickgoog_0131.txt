ODE XXXII.

‘Twnr call on us ior a song. Come, my tyre, I have drawn strains from thee
before which, light though they be, will not soon die: answer now with such
music ior Roman ears as thou yieldedst oi old to Alcaeus lle was a patriot and
a warrior, yet amidst his wars and shipwrecks he found time to sing oswine and
love. Olym, the. delight oi gods, the colace oi toil, help me too whenever 1 duly
call on thee.'

1t is not unlikely that the Ode reiers to some request oi Augustus or Maecenas
ior a poem oi a graver cast: Ritter thinks oi the stately Alcaic Odes which stand
at the beginning oi Book iii. There is au appearance oi reality in the appeal
oi the first stanm, and ln the pains which he takes to point out that lyrics on
Lycus' blaclr hair were not inconsistent in Alcaeus' case with civic real and
soldierly couragc. It is written, like Od. r. 1, 2. ao, 3. 30, when Horace had
become easy as to his own powers aud their recognition by the world. ·See,
however, on v. 1.
