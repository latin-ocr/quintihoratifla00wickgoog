ODE XI.

⁴ Mn wine is ready, and we are all astir preparing the senstt sor it is the Ides ol
April,Maeeenas’ birthday. Come, then, Phyllis, and keep it with met never mind
Telephus What are such ambitione loves to yon? Come, thou last oi my flames
(it shall be so, 1 swenr), come, and let ussing together!

Compare 3. 18, where he invites Lyde to spond the Neptunalia with him. The
point ol this Ode seems to lie, not in the invitation to Phyllis, which is only nn
incident in the holidayltoeping. bnt in the ocoasion, Maeeenas’ blrthday.

Whether the Ode was written at the time oi the leading Odes of the Book is

perhaps more than we can say; bnt it characterizes litly the relations os the poet
and his early patron at that time.
See lntrod. to the Book, pp. 279, 281.
