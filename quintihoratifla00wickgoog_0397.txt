QUANDO repostum Caecubum ad festas dapes
Victore laetus Caesare

Tecum sub alta-sic lovi gratum—domo,
Beate Maecenas bibam

Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra,
Hac Dorium, illis barbarum,

Ut nuper, actus cum freto Neptunius
Dux fugit ustis navibus,

Minatus Urbi vincla, quae detraxerat
Servis amicus perfidis?

Romanus, eheu-posteri negabitis-
Emancipatus feminae

Fert vallum et arma miles et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest,
