352 INTRODUCTION TO THE EPODES.

All the indicatione of date to be discovered in the poems them·
selves iix them to the first period of his life as an author. Their
references to current politics, both positively, as in the allusions to the
war with Sextus Pompeius, and negatively, in the vagueness with
which they deal with the general situation at home (see on Epod.
7 and 16), belong to the decade between the battles of Philippi and
Actium. We notice in their style indicatione which point the same
way-occasional harshnesses of construction, a redundancy of epithets‚
a tendency even in the best poems to poetical commonplace, we
may add a grossness of subject and language, which his mature
taste would have pruned away. The Epodes stand with the Satires
at the opening of Horace's literary life—not unconnected with them
in tone, nor in their literary antecedents, nor in their treatment in
his hande. The Roman Satirist, he tells us, looked, for all but the
poetical form of his composition, to Greek Comedy. In the Epode
he has returned to the personal lampoon, the earliest use of poetry
for purposes of attack and caricature, and that of which Comedy,
according to Aristotle (Poet. l. c), was the development It isin
the taste which feads him for models to Lucilius and Archilochus,
rather than iu any bitterness of special poems, that we may trace
probably his own description already referred to (Epp. a. a. 51 ;
see Introd. to Books i-iii‚ 5 ι) of the personal motives that first drove
him to write poetry. In any case it is characteristic of the man that
his Satires should mellow and humanize into the Epistles, and that
the Epodes should drop so early their ῖαμβικὴ ἰδία, and soften and
generalize into the Odes The process in both cases is nearly
complete before the name of the composition is changed.

Horace speaks himself (Epod. 14) of the Book as preparing for
publication, and as having occupied some space of time in com·
position. The date of its publication is generally held to be fixed by
the relation between Epod. 9 and Od. r. 37, to the year ac. 3¹·30·
