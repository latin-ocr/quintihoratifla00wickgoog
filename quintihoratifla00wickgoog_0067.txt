48 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE IV.

Tira lescen oi the Ode is the same, though not so explicitly put, as that oi Od. , ·,
4. 7 ‘immortalia ne speres monet annus.’ ‘We haue spring onoc more, all nature J. ·
is enjoying itself. ‘lake thy till oi pleasure, Sestius, ior death, which eomes to rich ,
and poor alilre, will soon be here, and then no more pleasores.'

The Sestius to whom it is addressed is probably identified with L. Sestius, son ⁸
oi the P. Sestius whom Cicero defended. He had served in M. Erutus’ army with
Horace. Dion 53. 3² mentions it to the credit oi Augustus, that he appointed ἶ
Sestius ⁴ Consul sniiectus’ in his own roem in uc. 23, although he was notorious „
ior preserving images oi Brutus, and honouring his memory.

Kiessling suggests, with probability, that the position oi Sestius as consul in the ,
year when the Odes were published explains the place given to the Ode as fourth iu , -·
the Book.

The metre (Archilochium thum> is irem Archilochus, Fr. 91 :-
