of epochs. Still, there would seem to have been some tradition oi
such recurrence to justisy Augustus' revival. On the dates of the
celebrations Censorinus' authorities differed. The length of the
‘saeculum' itself was diversely given at 110, as by Horace, and
roo years, as by Val. Antias, Livy, and Varro, whom Censorinus
quotes.

The historical performances are at varying periods, but all with
some reference toan intended secular date. Merivale writes, ‘The
emperor Claudius repeated the games in the year Α. nc. 800, dis·
regarding those of Augustus as irregular. Claudius was disregarded
in his turn by Domitian, who renewed the celebration in 841, antici·
patiug in his impatience, by six years, the period prescribed by
Augustus. To the Augustan computation Severus conformed pre·
cisely, and repeated the solemnity in 957, after two intervals of 110
years each. Philippus, however, returned once more to the precedent
of Claudius in the year of the City rooo. This was the last cele-
bration.'

The occasion of Augustus’ revival or institution of these games
was the close of what may be considered the first decade of the
empire, the renewal to him (though professedly only for five years
more), at his own request‚ of the ‘imperium’ which in ac. 27 he
had, apparently with difficulty, been persuaded to accept for ten
years.

The ‘quindecimviri' (see on v. 70, and cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 73), the
custodiens of the Sibylline Books, found in them the requisita instruc-
tions. Ateius Capito, a great jurist and antiquarian‚ was appointed
to settle the ceremonies. What these were we should have known
with exactness if we had possessed the account which Tacitus gave
(see Arm. 11. ιι), in a book of the Histories now lost, of the celebra·
tion in Domitian's reign, on which occasion he was himself one of the
quindecimviri and a praetor. As it is, the earliest extant account in
literature is that which is printed below from the historiari Zosimus (in
the middle of the fifth century). He claims, as it will be seen, for it the
authority of inscriptions (ἀναγέγραπται), and a fortunate discovery has
recentlyenabled us to verify and in one or two points to supplement or
correct his description.

In September, 1890, there were found built into a mediaeval wall
near the river bank in the old Campus Martius, by the present Church
of S. Giovanni de' Florentini, the fragments of two columns which
were erected in accordance with a ‘senatus consultum’ (‘ eo loco ubi
ludi futuri sint') to record severally the celebrations of the Secular
