HORATI CARMINUM

Iam Scythae laxo meditantur arcu
Cedere campis.

Neglegens‚ ne qua populus laboret,

Parce privatus nimium cavere, et

Dona praesentis cape laetus horae:
Linque severa.

ODE lX.

'll-11². reconciliation oi two lovers who have quarrelled: one is‘ Lydir,' the other
is not named. The form of the Ode is like the umoebean eclogues os Theocritus
and Virgil.

We may note the dramatic propriety os the leelings throughout.

His the pride os possession, hers the pride of being first in his eyes

His the attraction oi Chloe’s recomplishments, hers the happiness oi. love that
is returned.

llis the lordly relenting that offers to cast off Chlo'e' and open the gete aguin to
Lydia, hers (with one little womnnly hit in the implied comparison ol his beauty

with thnt oi Calais) the passionate delight‚ ior all his fickleuess and bnd temper. to

live and die with him.
