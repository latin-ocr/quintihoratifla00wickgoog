28 lN'TRODUCTlON TO THE

the deliverance (and this is emphasized by the place given to 37) from
the alternative rule of Antony and Cleopatra with its degrading accom-
paniments. The tone and arguments are still to a great extent those
of the Epodes. In Book ii we have less of politics ; but Ode 1 repeats
in the form of comments on Pollio's forthcoming history the poet’s

, disgust at the aimless bloodshed of the epoch which is closed, while

15, 16, 18, by their arraignment of social evils, prepare the way for the
positive aspectos the imperial rule which is to be shown in B. iii.
We notice that it is in this Book, as in neutral ground, that Horace finds
place (od. 7) for' reminiscenccs of the part which he had himself taken
and for his tribute to the lost cause. lt is in B. iii, after au exordium
which calls special attention as to something of higher import than
anything that has gone before, that he sets himself (Odes r-6, 24) to
describe at length the work which the new government is to do, and
the solid grounds on which good citizens should accept it, as promising
a regime of moderatiori and culture, the restoration of religion, of the
military spirit, of simple living and morality.

§ 14. As with the political Odes, so with the others, although the
chronological order of composition is in no sense the primary principle
of arrangement, and is at times demonstrably departed from, Horace
seems to have designedly given to each of the three Books a colour
and characteristics of its own. The First contains probably on the
whole his earlier compositious. In it are found most of his experi-
ments in metre (4. 7, 8, 28), most of the Odes which seem studies
from the Greek (as ro, 15, 30), or which take their waning-point
(as 9, 14, 18) from some known passage of Greek poetry. The
Second is the Book given most largely to personal friendship and
autobiographical touches. In the Third we find what on literary
grounds we feel to be Horace's maturest work-the Odes in which he
attains, if not his most perfect finisb, his greatest freedom, in which
the influence of Pindar seems to be supplanting that of the lesbian
poets. lt is the Book in which his metrical ear seems most exacting.
We may notice that the three Books are made to mark stages in the
poet's literary self-confidence. We pass from the deprecatory and
ironical tone of r, r, through 2. ao in which, although he applies to
himself the epitaph of Ennius he is still thinking (as in Sat r. 6) of
the taunts levelled athis humble origin, and finding his consolation in
the favour of Maecenas, to the triumphal tone of 3. 30, in which he

{aims the bay as his right, and associates himself with the eternity of
orne.
