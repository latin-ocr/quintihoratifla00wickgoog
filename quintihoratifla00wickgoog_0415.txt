HORATI EPODON

EPODE XVII.

Horace—l yield, Canidia. l acknowledge your power; cease your speils.
Achilles took compassion on Telephus, and gave back Hector's body to Priam's
prayers Circe restored Ulyssee’ companions to their own form. You have
punished me enough. Ihave lost the hue of youth; my bairis white; lcannot
rest day or night. 1 deny the power of your spells no more, for 1 have felt them.
Spare mei Ο earth and sea,1 bum with the fire of Nessus’ poison or of Aetna.
When is it to endi 1 will do anything you ask ; offer a hecatomb; tune my lyre
to falsehood, and sing of you as chaste and good. Stesichorus recovered his sight
on his palinnde. lion dou't come cibare parents3 you nererplnndered grareyards3
your heart is kind and your hands are clean3 Pactumeius is your true son.

Canidia-Yon speak to scaled ears. Are you to escape scot free after diruiging
the mysteries of Cotytto and witnessiag the witchcraft of the Esquiline, only to
make ir the talk of the town? If you do 1 shall have wasted my labour. Yon
wish to die, bnt you shall live to suffer. Tantalus, and Prometheus, and Sisyphus
would like to be set free from their punishment; but they are not. There is no
escape. The aword shall not pierce you, the noose shall not choke you. l will
ride iu triumph on your neck. 1 can call the moon from the sky and raise the dead
from their uma Do you think 1 can't deal with you?

Under the form of a recantation offered by himself and rejected by Canidia, he
repeats and aggravates the attacks upon her of Epod. 5 and Sat. r. 8. Her witch-
craft is taken for granted by both speakers. New or more definite charges are
made against her, though they are put in the form ‘yon did not,' &c She allows
every charge, and is augry only at their disclosure. The tone is more persoual

. than before. It is no longer Varus or some unnamed victim of her speils, but

Horace (see esp. v. 58), and it gives an interpretation to the other two poems. if
they had stood alone we might have thought that it was a class, or a public fully,
that he was assailing. But here we can hardly doubt that we have a persam
enmity, involving inore or less of real bitterness, and expressed uudera form more
or less allegorical. It is impossible to read the riddle completely. Horace doubt·
less dramatizes imaginary situations, but it is not in his way to sustaiu an imaginary
character through three entire poems‚ besides making it the object of allusions in
several others. Cp. Epod. 3. 8, Sat. r. r. 48, a.8. 95, andree Introd.to Od. 1. 16.
This Epode is posterior to Epod. 5and Sat. r. 8, for it contains references to them;
see vr. 47-52, 58.

IAM iam efficaci do manus scientiae,
