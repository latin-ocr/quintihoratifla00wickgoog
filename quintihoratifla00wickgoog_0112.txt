ODE XXIII.

‘You fly from me. Chloe, like a Irightened lrid to ite dam. I am not a tiger or
lion going to eat you. Yon are too old lor such shyneec’

We have possibly part oia Greek original to thia Ode in a fragment oi
Anacreon (Fr. 5² Bergk) :-

ἀγανῶς old re νεβρὸν νεοθηλέα

γαλαθηνόν, ὅστ’ lv ὕλης κεροέσσης
ἀπολειφθεὶς ὑπὸ μητρὸς ἐπτοήθη.

Adventus foliis seu virides rubum
Dimovere lacertae,
Et corde et genibus tremit
