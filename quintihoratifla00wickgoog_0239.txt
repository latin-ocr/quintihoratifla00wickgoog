220 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE Vlll.

Trrn Ode iswritten for an expected or imagined visit oi Maecenas, on the first
anniversary oi the poet’s narrow escape from the falling tree (π. 13, a. 17. η, 3. ,μ
27). The festival oi March 1 was the Matronalia. Maecenas is supposed on his
entry to wonder what can be the reason theta bachelor's home shows preparation
ior sacrifice on such aday. The answer is, that the poet is paylngarowto Bacchus,
which he had made at the time ol his miraculons preservation. ‘The best wine is
to be brought out,' and so the Ode passcs into an invitation to Maecenas to enter
into the spirit ol the time-to torget the troubles ol State. ‘All is going well;
the Dacians are checked, the Parthians quarrelling among themselves, even the
Cantabrian subdued at last, and the Scythicus unstringing their bows; Maecenas
may enjoy a little privacy and immunity t'rom care.‘
