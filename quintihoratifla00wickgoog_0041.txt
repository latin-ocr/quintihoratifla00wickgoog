22 INTRODUCTION TO THE

‚which year the news ol their rising reached Augustus in Gaul, and
diverted him (see above, ξ 3) lrom his intended expedition to Britain.
He was commanding in person against them in nc. 25, but leil ill and
was detained at Tarraco lor some months. In the meantime the war
was concluded by C. Antistius and T. Carisius, his ‘legati' Augustus
himself returned home in nc. 24. In the same year they rose again
(Dion 53. 28) and seized by stratagem and killed some Roman soldierS,
but were again put down by L. Aemilius.

The expressions oi Od. 2. 6. 2 ‘Cantabrum indoctum iuga serre
nostra,’ and 2. 11. 1 ‘Quid bellicosus Cantaber . . . cogitet: would be
intelligible at any time during this period, and as each conquest would
be thought final till the next rising, there is nothing even in the words
ol 3. 8. 21 (ί Servii Hispanae vetus hostis orae Cantaber sera domitus
catena’) to lix thern necessarily to a single date. Other considerations
perhaps place the Ode, as we shall see, either iu nc. 29 or in 25.

The final subjugation os the Cantabri by Agrippa iu nc. 19 (Dion
54. ιι) does not come within the period ol Odes i-iii, but is recorded
in Epp. 1. 12. 26, and alluded to in Od. 4. 14. 4¹·

§y Daci, Getae, Scythae, Geloni-There is much vagueness in the

· use ol these names by Horace, as indeed there is consessedly in their

use by prose writers ol much later date. The name ‘Scythae' is the
most comprehensive, being used apparently sor all the tribes north ol
the Danube and Euxine. At times it is brought into close relation
with that ol the Getae (as in Od. 3. asur), who again are closely
connected by all writers with the Daci. At other times it is asso-
ciated with the Geloni and the Tanais (‘ Scythicus amnis,' Od. 3. 4.
36), and denotes tribes lar enough to the East to intersere in Parthian
politics. The names are ollen used merely as poetical expressions ol
distance, the extreme North (as in Od. 2. 2ο), or generally for the
northern tribes, as the supposed representatives ol the manlier virtues
(asin Od. 3. 24) or as the objecta ol the vague lears of Roman states· ¹
men (od. 2. 11. ι).

The Daci are mentioned by Dion 51· 22 as ollering their services to

Octavianus, and when their terrns were declined by him joining
Antony, to whom, however, they rendered little assistance, as they
were quarrelling amongst themselves (see Od. 3. 6. 13).

In nc. 3ο, M. Crassus, at the bidding oi Octavianus, marched
northward from Macedonia, and won some victories over the Daci

and Bastarnae as well as the Moesi, lor which in sc. 27 he was
allowed a triumph, Dion 51. 23.
