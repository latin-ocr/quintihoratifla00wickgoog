HORATI CARMINUM

Illum et parentis crediderim sui
F regisse cervicemet penetralia
Sparsisse noctumo cruore
Hospitis; ille venena Colcha
Et quicquid usquam concipitur nelas
Tractavit, agro qui statuit meo
Te triste lignum, te caducum
ln domini caput immerentis.
Quid quisque vitet, numquam homini satis
Cautum est in horas: navita Bosporum
Poenus perhorrescit neque ultra
Caeca timet aliunde sata,
Miles sagittas ct celerem lugam
Parthi, catenas Parthus et Italum
