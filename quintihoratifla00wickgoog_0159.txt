140 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE lV.

‘No need to blush, Xauthias, though yon love a slave girl. Achilles had his
Briseis, and Ajax his Tecmessa; even Agamemnon, the conqueror oi Troy, could
not withstand Cassandra. Who knows bnt Phyllis too ia some born princess:
oue so coustant and so indifferent to money ceu spring irom nornlgarstoelr. Nay,
don’t suspect my praises, 1 am close on forty.’

We can hardly be wrong iu supposing that, with the exception oi her pretty
iace and ligure, the pralses oi Phyllis are meant to be interpreted ironicnlly. ΤῙιο
mock heroic tone of the list oi precedente (cp. Od. 1. 16,1ntrod..andep0d 3),
the ‘regium certe,’ and the contempt implied sor her real birth, ‘ scelesta plebe,⁸
might be merely playiu13 but consideriug the topics oi praise, ‘slc fidelem, sic
lucro aversam: there is hardly feeling errough iu their expression, standing aa they
do between the levity oi stanzas 4 and 6, to redeem the playiulnees from the sting
oi irony.

And possibly the Ode refers to some real person, although the name be tictitlous.
The irony would be wasted ou a shadow; and there is a defiuiteness both in the
name oi the ‘ Phocian’ Xanthias and iu the introduction oi Horace's own person·
ality (staura ὁ), which is more dramatie than ls usual in the purely imaginary
Odes It is undoubtedly Horace’s way to add a local designation to fictitious
characters: ‘Cnidius Gyges,' Od. 2. 5. τος ‘Liparaei nitor Hebri‚' 3.12.6. ln
some casea, as in ‘Thurini Calais tilius Omyti,' 3. 9. 14, the appearance oi com·
plete identification is strongly iu point, and iu all the object probably wasto give
a greater semblance oi reality. The purpose here is the less easy to imagine, from
the laet that the name is addressed to Xanthias himself, not used bywayos identit'y·
ing him to others. Ii the lover ol the Ode was a real person, there may oi course
be some play in the name, of which the point is lost to us. Orelli suggests that
‘Xanthias’ may be chosen to cover a Roman ‘Flauius' cp. od. 3. ¹5· 11, where he

in Rome, and, comparing Od. 1. 27.10 ‘Megillae irater Opuntiae,' ingeniously
suggests that the persam there rallied is none other thau Xanthias, aud that the
‘Phyllis’ os this Ode is the ‘Charybdis’ of that. .

The composition oi the Ode is fixed by v. ²4 to the end oi Horace’s lortieth
year, ec. ²5·
