INDEX OF METRES. 415

periods, and held that the arrangement in lines, which many editors
debate, was merely a necessity ol the writer or printer, and not to be
elevated into a law of the metre.

ξ 6. Α few words may be added on what is called by some editors
‘hleineke's canon! He noticed that, with two exceptions, all the
Odes¹ ol Horace contain a number oi lines which is a multiple of four.
Ol these, 3. 12 has just been discussed. It has been arranged by some
persons in stanzas ol lour lines (see Excurs. on it in Orelli’s edition);
but it might fairly be contended, either that the nature ol the metre
consisting not ol verses, but ol leet, exempted it srorn the common
category, or that, inasmuch as it consists ol lour periods os ten feet
each, it complies with the same conditione as other Odes. The other
exception is Od. 4. 8, which contains thirty-four verses. lt so
happens that this Ode already lay under some suspicion, on account
oi the historical difficulty osv. 17¹. On these laets Meineke laid
down the general law that all the Odes confonned to the type os the
Alcaic, Sapphic, and third, lourth, and fifth Asclepiad metres, and
were to be broken into loun-line stanzrs. Od. 4. 8 was to be rectified
by the necessary amount ol excision, or by the supposition ol some
lines having lallen out. It will be seen, on examination, that the dilli-
culties ol 4. 8. ry have been exaggerated; and, at any rate, in the
absence ol any indication os such a quatemary division, either in the
pauses ol the Odes themselves, or in the grammatical and metrical
writers (who are usually keen-eyed for ‘laws’ in the greater poets),
the chiel recent editors have not thought it necessary to alter the Ode
in obedience to the canon. Steiner pointed out that, whatever may
have been the case with the Odes which are composed in couplets,
there are but five other Odes besides 4.8 (omitting, again, 3. ra)
which are μονόστιχα, or ol unilorm metre, and that this is too small an
area lor such an important induction.

¹ 'l’he law is not applied to the Epodes, ¹ Bentley had complalned ol the same
the very name ol which (see p. ³51) line, on account ol the metrical irre·
probably implied an arrangement in gularity oi the caesum see above,
conpleta rather thau four-line stannes. l t.
