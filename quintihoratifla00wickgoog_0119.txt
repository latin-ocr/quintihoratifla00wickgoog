ODE XXVII.

IN od. r. 18 the poet hed recommended moderetion in the use oswine on moral
and religions grounds. Here his objectis the seme though the tone is lighter.
The Ode is a dramatic sketch os a banquet which is degenereting into a drunken
brewl. Horuoe interrupte it by err appenl, playsul in its mixture os the Bscchic
hierophnnt with the geninl poet os good living. The compunywould reply to
their monitor by filling his gloss ‘On one condition only.' he noys, end diverts
them nt onoe from his own lecture and their rising querrel to an absorbing interest
in the love affairs of Megilla's brother, his bashsulness‚ his imagined confidences,
his mysteriously hopeless fate.
