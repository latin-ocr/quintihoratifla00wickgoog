PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

—00—

In preparing after some interval a new issue of the
larger edition of the Odes and Epodes, Ι have been
able, l hope, to correct positive errors which I had
discovered or which had been pointed out by kind
critics; and l have had the opportunity of recon-
sidering a good many difficult questions with the
assistance of valuable books on the text and inter·

pretation of Horace which have appeared since my
last edition. Ι should especially mention, although
they are not the only ones, Keller’s Epilegomena
Kiessling's edition, the Horaz Studien of Pluss, the
second volume of the Roman Poets of the Augustan
Age, by the lamented Prof. Sellar, and several papers
on the historical reference of the Odes by Mommsen.
