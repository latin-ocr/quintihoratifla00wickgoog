I.—THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE ODES.

5 1. Tun general period during which the greater number of the
Odes of Boohs i-iii must have been composed can be fixed with
some certainty. The earlier Irinit is fixed by the Battle ofActium.
Epod. 9 was written immediately after the victory, while even the
direction of Antony’s flight was still unknown. Od. 1. 37 is written
on Cleopatra's death in the following autumn, nc. 30.

It is of course possible that some of the Odes may have been com-
posed before the Epodes were finished, but there is none that bears
any clear mark of it In the absence of such proof the presumption
is against it: for Horace's usual practice seems to be to finish one
collection of poems before he begins another. There is development
of style within one collection in the direction of the next, but
no appearance of overlapping. That the Epodes themselves were
sostening into something hardly distinguishable from the Odes‚ and
that some of the Odes retain metres, or even the tone, of the Epodes,
malres it more difficolt to understand why, if particular Odes were
written before 31, they were not included in the volume of Epodes

ᾗ 2. The second Itirtd, the latest date at which the Three Boolrs as
a whole can have been published‚ is fixed mainly by the reference in
Od. 1. 12. 45-48. Marcellus died in the autumn of nc. ²3· Itis in-
conceivable that these lines should be (as Ritter suggests) a complimen·
tary allusion to one already dead; an assurance to Augustus that at
least the fame of his son-in-law survived: all that the author of the
dirge on Quintilius could offer to match Virgil's ‘Tu Marcellus eris!
And it is ,almost equally impossible that, written before his early
death, they should have been published (as from other considerations
