26 lNTRODUCTlON TO THE

dedication oi Epp. r. 1 and 19, and ol Od. r.r and 3. ²9 to Maecenas,
while in each case the last poem in the collection, Epp. 1. ao, Od. 3. 30,
is reserved lor the poet's literary seli-consciousness. The references
in Book iv. treat the three preceding Books as awhole-as eg. in the
relation ol 4. 1 to 1. 19 and 3. 26, as one ol the earliest and the latest
oi the love Odes ol his earlier poetry. Above all, it is only when this
unity is recognized that we perceive that lull significance in the
arrangement of the Odes which the example of the Fourth Book
· prepares us to expect¹.

§ rr. Some kind os conscious arrangement subsequent to composi·
tion, and not chronological, is obvious on the lace ol the Epodes,
Satires, and Epistles. There is at least the choice oi the opening
. poem, not usually ¹, il ever, earliest in date ol composition, an apology
lor the style ol writing as in Sat. ii. or a quasi-dedicatory address as in
the Epodes, Sat. i, and both Books of the Epistles. And there are
reasons frequently to be detected lor the J'uxtaposition or separation ol
particular poems. In the Epodes, lor instance, we notice especially
the metrical arrangement oi 1-10, 11-16, 17, and the distribution at
intervals ol poems upon the same subject, such as those upon Canidia
(5 and ι17) and those in which he touches politics (r, 7, 9, 16)⁸.

5 ra. It is natural that the art expended on the arrangement ol the
Odes‘ should be greater. The moods which they reflect are more
various, and the poems are of a kind which has more to gain by
contrast or preparation. But there is agreater reason in the delicacy
os the ground upon which they enter, in respect to the politica ol the
time. Horace has in them to justify his change os sides, neither to
ignore nor to make too much ol it—he has to praise with tact one,
‘cui male si palpere, recalcitrat ²-he has with dignity and without
offence to do justice to old friendships and old ideals. In this task he
takes reluge in the irony, partly a method ol his art, partly a natural
