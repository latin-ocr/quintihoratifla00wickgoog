CARMEN SAECULARE.

‘Pflossus and Diana, grant the prayers duly offered at this secred senson
(v. 1-8).

Ο sun, ever changing yet ever the sarm, let Rome’s pre-eminence be as chunge-
maffia

Diana, birth goddess, guard our mothers (u. 13-16).

Bless our new marriage lawr to the increase of onr people, thnt each “saeculnm ”
