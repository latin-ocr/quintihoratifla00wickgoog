ODE IX.

‘lr is midwinter. well, pile ou more logs, and bring out larger supplies oi
wine. When the godewill, spring willcomebaclr. Do not loolr sornam.- Each
day that yon get is so much gained. Enjoy it Love and danae and play while
yon can, for old age is coming!

The lessons os Epicureanism drawn ior winter, as Ode 4drew them sor spring.

The opening ia copied from Alcaeus, Fr. 34:-

ὕει ptr ά Ζεύς, he δ’ ὀρανῶ μέγας
χεάμονν, πεπάγασιν θ’ ὑδάτων ῥόαι.

κάββαλλε τάν χείμανν’, tel μὲν ridear

μελιχρόν, αὐτὰρ epol κόρσᾳ
μαλθακὸν άμφιτάθη γνόφαλλον.

Horace has given a Roman dress to it, aud the conclusion is probably his own,

‘Thaliarchus‘ is neither a real proper name, nor the title oi an office, as though
itwere the same as συμποσίαρχος, bnt an imaginary name, chosen or coined with
a view to its etymological meaning ‘ prince ot' good cheer,' and meant to describe
the person addressed as the representative ol youth and merrirnent

Compare Epod. 13 with its sudden change to the singular number in r. 6, as
though he were addressing the master or the ‘ruler oi the feast) ‘Tu vina Tor·
qnato more Consule pressa meo. The whole poem preseuts a strong resemblance
in thought and expression.
