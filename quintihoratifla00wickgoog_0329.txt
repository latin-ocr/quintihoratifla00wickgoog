3¹0 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE VII.

‘Status has returned to earth, and with it foliage and light and warmth. It will
not last for ever: this is the lesson of revolving seasons Only they pass to return
again3 we, when we pass where the great and good are gone before ns, are dust
and nothing. Today may be your last3 who knowsl Take your fili of enjoy-
menu What you spend on yourself is at leuat so much the less for your greedy
heir. When once you are dead and passed Minos’ grand tribunal, neither rane,
Torquatus, nor eloquence‚ nor goodness, will restore you to the light. Think of
Hippolytus and Pirithous, and leam this lusson from their fate!

Torquatus is the same person, doubtless, whom Horace addressed in Epp. 1. 5.
to much the same purpose as in this Ode; but more than that it is difficuit to say,
notwithstanding the many gnesscs that have been offered on the subject The two
most plausible ones are. (r) that of Estrf, who identihes with him the Aulus Tor·
qnatus mentioned in Corn. Nep. Atticus, as amongst those who were compromised
by their share in Brutus and Cassins’ campaign. This would give an occasion for
Horace's acquaintance with him. (a) That of tt'eiehcre who thinks that he
was no member of the Manlia gens, bnt the C. Nonius Asprenas mentioned by
Suetonius (Oct. 43 aud 56), the intimate friend of Angustus, who had assumed for
himself aud his family the cognomen of Torquatus by permission oi the emperor,
and in memory of a golden ‘ torques’ with which Augustus had presented him on
the occasion of his injuring himself by a fall while performing in the Ludus Troiae.
His assumption of the name has been held to prove, what there are no other facts
to dispmm, that thc old family of Torquati was extinct.

The Ode is remarkably parallel to 1. 43 so much so. that Macleane is inclined
to think that it was omitted on this account from the first three Books, and only
published under the necessity of making up a respectable number to meet Augustus'
requirement of a fourth Boolr. There is nothing to indicate its date.
