280 INTRODUCTION TO THE

being still interested in politics,a change which tallies with the date
assigned by Dion (54. 19) to his loss of the favour of Augustus and to
his retirement from public affairs in a. c. 16 ; and (a) he is no longer
the patron to whose praise Horace looks as his highest reward The
three Books of Odes have been published for some time, and the
verdict anticipated in 3. 30 has been accorded to them. Their author
is now the intimate of Augustus He has been selected to compose
the hymn for the Secular Games, and the public voice ratified the
emperor's choice. He is now writing, not in the hope of winning
a name for himself, but at the desire of Augustus, and beoeuse his
praise will confessedly give lustre to the emperor and his family.

It may be added, that the versification of the leading Odes gives
some witness to the lateness of their composition ; the Sapphic Odes in
the frequency of the heremimcral caesura, which assimilates them to
the Carm. Sacc. ; and the Alcaic in the greater strictness with respect
to the structure ol v. 3 of the stanza, and the complete exclusion of
the short anacrusis in vv. r, 2, 3 (sce Index of llletres).

It has been said before (p. 26) that Book iv exhibits more proofs
ol artistic purpose in its arrangement than any other collection ol
Horace’s poema

r. ‘lhe most obvious instance, perhaps, is the disposition of the
four Odes lor the sake of which we may say the Book was composed.
They stand in two pairs at the beginning ol the Book (after a prelude,

⁸ which will be noticed presently) and at its end. Each pair is divided

between Augustus and one of the young princes; so that any praises
ol the latter may seem to lead up to and merge themselves in the
glory of the former.

2. Scarcely less noticeable is the sequence ol thought expressed or
suggested in the three Odes which precede the main theme. It has

been remarked before (p. 27) that a somcwhat similar relation may be
traced in the first Ode ol Book i 5 but the prelude here is more

elaborate, and the irony is more couscious. He has been asked to
take up his lyre again to sing the glory ol the emperor and his step·
sons, and he begins as usual with ‘ denial vain and eoy excuse! ‘ He

will take his lyre, indeed, but it is at Venus' bidding, to renew under
her compulsion the bitter-sweet themes which he hoped he had laid
aside' Ode a is to the same purport, though it carries us a little
further by the end. ‘He is no swan of Pindaric song, such as is
needed for so high a task. Some greater poet, Antonius himself,
may sing of Augustus returning in triumph with the Sygambri at his
chariot wheels, and ol the people's joy. lt may be, in the rapture
