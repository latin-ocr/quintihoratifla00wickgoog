Α stoctt heroic invective against garlic. Horace hus eaten some dish seasoned
with it at Maecenas' table, and he treats it as a practloal jolre of his host's (v. ao
‘iocose Maecenas ’). ‘Garlic should be substituted sor hemloelr lu the punishment
of parricidas. Whateau the reapers’ stomachsbemade ol l He has taken poison-
viper’s blood, some decoctiou oi Canidia’s-the very dmg which Medea used to
prevent the bulls touching Jason, and to destroy Creiisa. The hest ol Apulia in
the dog-days, os Hercules' fiery garment, was nothing to it. li Maecenas has the
bad taste to have such s dish again, may he be rewarded by finding that he cannot
get a kiss it he wishes it!
