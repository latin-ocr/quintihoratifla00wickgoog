12 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

me legere apud Heleniom Acronem Saganam fuisse libertum Pom·
ponii senatoris qui a triumviris est proscriptus! Itis to be remarked,
however, that the statement thus quoted does not occur in the Scholia
which go under Acron's name. On the other hand, we find in them
the change of tense already noticed with respect to sacrifices, etc,
which would point to their being later than the prohibition of heathen
ceremonies by Theodosius in no. 391 ; we lind (unless these be inter-
polatione) the names of the Goths (on Od. 4. 15. aa), and according
to‘one MS. of the Huns (on Od. 2. rr. 1)‚and abiut perhaps of the
desolation of Italy hythe barbarians (on Od. 3. 4. 16); and we find,
subject to the same proviso, references to Priscian (fifth century) on
Epp. a. 1. 228, and to Priscian's teacher Theoctistus on Sat. 1. 5. 97.
It is mainly on those grounds that Keller distinguishes the Acron who
was one of the commentators used by Porphyrion from the composer
or composers of the Scholia'which now bear the name, and which
were composed by some one who had Porphyrion's commentary in
his hands and used it largely. These Pseudo-Acronian Scholia he
relegates to the fifth century. Upon grounds on which it ia less easy
to leel secure in following him, he divides them into two parts; the
first (up to the beginning of the Fourth Book of the Odes with part of
those in the Fourth Book and most of the Epodes) belonging to the
earlier half of the century3 the remalnder he places in the second half,
and identifies as their author Fabius Planciades Fulgentius, a grarn-
marian of that date, one of whose works, three books of mythology,
is found with no mark of a new author on the same MS. with the
Schol. Acron.

The socalled ‘Commentator Cruquianus' is not an independent
authority, the name being given toa medley of notes, in the main
atranscript or paraphrase of Acron and Porphyrion, printed by

Cruquius from marginal or interlinear annotations on his Blandi·
nian MSS.

It may be convenient for purposes of reference to add a chrono-
logical list of the chief edzhhns of Horace earlier than the present
century (chiefly from Mitscherlich).

The ‘editio princeps' is not certainly known: the title is usually given
to an edition without name or date, which is supposed to have
been published by Zarotus at Milan in 1470. The first edition,
