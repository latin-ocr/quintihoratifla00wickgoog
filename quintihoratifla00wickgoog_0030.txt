TO THE ODES. 11

from the text interpreted in the commentary, and can only by them·
selves carry us back to the date of the oldest MS. of the Scholia, via.
at the earliest to centuries 9·¹0= On questions of interpretation, and
especially of allusione to customs, sites, and persons, the Scholia have
value, independently of any doubt as to their writer’s precise date or
personal acquaintance with Roman life, from the fact that they
bear evidence of having been composed by men who had in their
hands early authorities which are otherwise lost to us. These are
sometimes referred to by name, as Terentius Scaurus (a grammarian
of Hadrian’s time who wrote a commentary on the Ars Poetica) on
Sat. a. 5. 923 Claranus (Martial. ιο. 21. a, Seneca, Ep. 66) οι) Sat.
a. 3. 83 3 more often generally as ‘nonnulli,' ‘alii' ‘plerique' ‘com-
mentator' (Aer. on Α. Ρ. 120), ‘qui de personis Horatianis scripse-
runt’ (Porph. on Sat. 1. 3. 21 and 91, a. 5. 9²)·

O. Keller,¹ who has collected and used with much ingenuity all the
available evidence on the subject, gives the palm of antiquity to the
Scholia of Porphyrion. The only limit set to their date by extemal
testimony is to be found in the mention of Porphyrion's name by
Charisius,a grammatieal writer, usually placed about Μ). 400; but
Keller thinks they are as early as 200-250 Μ). The evidence on
which he relies consists wholly of indications in the Scholia them·
selves, such as (a) the writer's personal knowledge of Rome coupled
with the fact that he never alludes to the walls of Aurelian (Μ). 271),
while he recognizes the older gates, as eg. the Porta Esquilina on
Epod. 5. 100, Sat. 1. 8. 1 ; (b) his use of Parthi, Parthicus, etc. as
designatione of the great eastern monarchy, in several places where
the Pseudo-Acron uses Persae, Persicus, a natural variation if the fall
of Parthia and the rise of the Persian dynasty of the Sassanidae
(Μ). 226) bad taken place between the two dates; (c) his way of
speaking of the religious ceremonies of heathen Rome as though they
were still observed in his own time. Contrast, e.g., his note on Od.
3. 11. 6 ‘fidicines hodieque Romae sacrificiis adhiberi videmus’ with
Acron's ‘et in sacrificiis fidicines adhiberi consueverant,’ or that on
Od. a. 16. 14 ‘salinum patella in qua primitiae dis cum sale dantur’
with Acron's ‘patella in qua dis primitiae offerebantur,’ or lastly, that
on 3. 5. 11 ‘Aeternam Vestam, propter aeternos ignes qui in ara eius
coluntur ’ with Acron’s ‘ aeterni ignis qui in ara eius indefesse colebatur!

The genuine Acron wrote earlier than Porphyrionis the latter’s
quotation of blm on Sat. 1. 8. 25 is not an interpolation, ‘memini
