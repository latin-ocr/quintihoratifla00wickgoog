ODES, BOOKS l-lll. 21

Ode, Dion 53. aa, a5l; and 1. 29, which seems to refer to prepara·
tions more or less immediately preceding Aelius Gallus’ expedition
into Arabia Felix in nc. 24.

ξ 4. Those who would go much beyond this in fixing with accuracy
the date of single Odes have to lean a good deal on Horace’s references
to events on the frontier and beyond it, movements of the Cantabrian,
the Scythian, the Parthian. ln estimating the value of these it is of
course necessary to be sure of the nature of the allusion. We are in
danger of confusing poetry with history when we look too closely into
every mention of Dacian or Indian and search the pages of Dion or
Strabo for some detail that will exactly suit it. Horace's verses are
full of the feeling of the greatness of the Roman empire, the remote·
ness of its frontiers, the immense charge which Caesar has taken on
himself. And the names of distant and unknown places and tribes
had a spell in ancient times which they have lost in days of maps and
geography. Even when we corne to more definite references, as
those to the quarrels of Phraates and Tiridates, orto the frequent
risings of the Cantabri, though we have here ample ground for dating
generally the period during the course of which tbe poems must have
been composed, and exactly‚ if we know the date ofa special event
referred to, the year before which the particular poem could not have ¹
been composed, we yet soon get to the point where the event has
become a standing illustration of the vicissitudes of fortune or a
statesmau's anxietiea a poetical commonplace which may recur till it
is supplanted by some fresh circumstance which strikes the poet’s
imagination.

To this it must be added that the foreign history of the time is
imperfectly known to us, and that some uncertainty hangs over the
dates of several of those events which are known.

§5. It may be convenient and may save some repetitions to give
shortly in this place the few facts which are known with respect to the
Cantabrians, the Dacians and Scythians, and the Parthians, to which,
if to any known historical events, allusions in these Books must have

reference.

ξ 6. The Cantabri, a tribe living in the mountains of the northern
coast of Spain, are named by Dion (51. 20), with their neighbours the
Astures, asin arms against Rome at the time of the general paci·
fication in nc. 29, and as being conquered in that year by Statilius
Taurus. The next mention of thern is in nc. 26 (Dion 53. 25¹, in
