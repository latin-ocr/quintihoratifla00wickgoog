with the exception of the first two and part of the third of Book 1,
besides large portions of the Odes. The Odes are not arranged

the distinction of Books is not marked. They are succeeded by some
of the Epodes, then by the Carm. Saea, then by the remaining Odes
and Epodes‚ also in their usual order. The Ars Poet. 1-440 follows
the Epodes‚ then Sat. 1. ι,2 and part of 3. The omissions in the
Odes and Epodes are as follows :-of whole Odes in B'ook Ι. Odes
3-7‚ 9‚rr‚ 33 and 343in Book 111, Ode3 ; and of Book IV, Odesg
and 15, besides parts of twenty-one more Odes and Epodes, viz. Odes
