v. 52 as addressed to thern, and imagines the Ode to have been sung processionally,
begun and ended on the palatine, these middle stannes being the part sung on the
Capitoline It is difficult to see how the words os the inscription ‘eodemque modo
iu Capitolio,' whether they be complete as they stand or were supplemeuted by
words now lost, can describe such a division oi the Ode. Their natural inter-pre
tation is oi a complete repetition. And indeed it is not trne. as Mommsen sup
posca, that this passage os the Ode, and no other, belongs to the Capitoline deities
There is a symmetry which he does not notice between the earlier part ol the Ode
which consists oi prayer, and the latter pert (v. 53 to the end) ln which the chorus
ussures itsell that its prayers are heard and granted. In both cases the deities put
in the loreground are Apollo and Diana, bnt in both cases the reference to them

generalius, so that they seem ro become representatives oi the whole company oi
gods, and the last stanna ln each case indicates or names Jove.
