HORATI CARMINUM

ODE ll.

‘Wnacrrr has uo value save to use well: used as Proculeius used it, it wins
immortal farne. 'l'o tarne the spirit of avarice is more thau to ovm the world.
Avarice is like the thirst of dropsy, which grows by indulgence. Virtue calls him
alone happy, him alone the true king, who has subdued the love of money.⁸

That the Ode is addressed to Sallustius is enough to show that there could be
no danger of the world‘s applying its doctrine to him.

The little we know of him is chiefly derived from Tacitus, Anu. 3. 30, where
his death in an. ao is recorded: ‘Crispum equestri loco, C. Sallustius rerum

Romanarum florentissimus auctor, sororis nepotem, in nomen adscivit. Atque ille
quanquam prompto ad capessendos honores aditu, Maecenatem aemulatus, sine
dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium consulariumque potentia anteiit, diversus
a veterum instituto per cultum et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu propior.
Suberat tamen vigor animi negotiis par, eo acrior quo somnum et inertiam magis
ostentabat. Igitur incolumi Maecenate proximus, mox praecipuus cui secreta
imperatorum inniterentur, et interficiundi Postumi Agrippae conscius, aetate pro-
vecta speciem magis in amicitia principis quam vim tenuit.’ Pliny (N. H. 34. a)
mentions that the Sallust family possessed eopper mines in the Tarentaise (⁸ Cen·
tronum tractu '), aud it has been suggested that this gave a special point to thefirst
staura, ‘As you know from your experience of ore.' The true person of the Ode,
, however, is Proculeius, the example of the right use of wealth—aud he (see note
on vv. 5-8) was the brother-lnlaw of Maecenas and the friend of the Emperor-so
that the Ode becomes a compliment to them.
