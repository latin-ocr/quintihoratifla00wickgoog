ODE ΙΙΙ.

‘De Iustitia et Constant& Firmness os purpose is characterired in vv. 1-8.

lt is the tinne by which Pollux and Hercules, and Angustus and Bacchus, roae to ⁸

heaven, by which Romulus overeame the opposition of Juno, and won immortality
ior himself and world-wide empire lor Rome. Juslice is not absent from the early
atauus of the Ode, t'or it isa just as well as a firm purpose which is glorified in
them3 bnt it is the keynote ol Juno's speech.vv.18-68. She yields to the per·
mering purpose ol Romulus and oi Rome. Her wrath was against the ⁴ periura
Pn'ami domna,' the ‘unjust judge’ v. 19, the promise-breaker, v. aethe violator ol
the lawa oi hospitallty and ol marriage, v. 2 5. They have been puniahed, end she
is nitated As long ns beasts of the field hide their whelps on the tombs ol Priam
and Paris, the Capitol may stand in its glory. Rome may extend her away over
the world, only let her leave gold in the mine, send her citizens to the world's end
in search oi empire, not ol treasure. And let her beware ebore all· things ol the
dream oi rebuildlng the doomed city oi Troy. Troy rebnilt, Juno's wreth will
sevire, and the aeeond lull shall be as bed es the suat.

For the meaning oi this lest waming see the note nt the end ol the Ode.

Several MSS, including V and A (B omits the Odea 2-6), wrote this Ode con·
tinnonaly with the Second, and Porphyrion, noticing the question, decides that they
