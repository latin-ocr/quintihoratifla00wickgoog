‘Linus Eronos} ‘Liber vsu· qui Epodon inscribitur,' are the titles
by which this Book is headed in Mss„ and cited by the grammatical
and metrical writers ol the fourth and fifth centuries, Marius Victorinus,
Diomedes, Fortunatianus. The separate poema are called Odae.
The word Epode (ἐπῳδός) was a recognized metrical term sor the
shorter verse of a couplet, which is as it were the echo (ἐπᾴδεται,
‘accinitur ') oi the longer one, and then συνεκδοχικῶς sor the metre or
poem (more properly ‘carmen epodicum ⁹) in which such a sequence
occurred ¹. Elegiae verses are thus admitted as Epodic by Victorinus
(p. 2500), but in common use the term was appropriated to the
couplet metres os Archilochus and their Horatian imitations. It
may be noticed that such merres are not peculiar to the so·called
‘Epodes’ Two oi the couplets known specially by Archilochus' name
occur only in the Odes (ι. 4, and 4. 7), the latter is the one example
oi an ‘Epodus' quoted from Horace by Terentianus Maurus.

Horace’s own name lor these poems is ‘Iarnbi’ (Epod. ¹4· 7, Od. r.
16. 3 and 24, Epp. 1. 19. 25), a term which implied their character at
least as much as their mette (cp. the Greek verb ἰαμβίζειν, and see
Arist. Poet. c. 4, 5, cp. Hor. A. P. 79 ‘Archilochum proprio rabies
armavit iambo ’).
