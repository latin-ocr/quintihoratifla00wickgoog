ADDITIONAL NOTE
01v veresas 25, 26.

The Corum. Cruq. seems to have read ‘Africano' for it stands so not only in
the lemma, but also in the construction of the sentence in his note ‘neque Africano
triumpho reportasti parem Augusto ducem! With this reading the lines have
been taken in two ways r

r. Ritter and Nauck make ‘Africano [belloJ' the antecedent to ‘cai,’ ‘in
[that] warin Africa for which Valonr made a hunsl-place in the ruins of
Carthuge! This has the advantage of avoiding the gravest objection which
Bentley takes to the reading: ‘Africano' is not made by itself the antithesis
to ‘Iugurthin0,' for the clause ‘cui,' δια, indicates what ‘war in Africa' is meant.
‘Africano’ however remains iu this case, it must be confessed, in a place where
we look fora word of emphasis, sornewhat tame and ueedless. The phrase
‘sepulcrum condere bello' may have had literary antecedeuts which if we knew
them would explain it. ln itself it does not read quite like Horace, and Cicero's
‘bellum sublatum et sepultum' (Leg. Mau. 11. 30), which is quoted, falls much
short ofit.

a. Pliiss, in the chapter of his Horas Studien already referred to, gives a new
turn to the whole passage by making the antecedent to ‘cui' not ‘bello' but
‘ducem‘ The lines, he says, are ironical. ‘Ducem' is used not of the conquer-
ing general, but of tbe conquered‚ who is brought home to grace the triumph.
Cleopatra is the person meant, and compared to Jugurtha and to Hasdrubal. 'l‘be
words ‘ cui super Carthaginem,' dec.. are explained of Hasdrubal’s brave words ψ
(Polyb. Rell. 39. a), καλὸν ἐντάφιον vivat τοῖς εὖ φρονοῦσι τὴν πατρίδα reci τὸ ταύτης
πῦρ, in spite of which he afterwards surrendered to Scipio. The fatal objectiou to
this theory, ingenious aud tempting as it is, is the necessity which it involves of
taking ‘Africano' by itself as=‘ Punico,’ as though the Jugurthine war was not
also ‘Africanum'

Kiessling adopts Madvig's neat emendation ‘Africani’ i.e. ‘neque bello cui
Africani virtus sepulcrum condidit! This would avoid many, but not all, of the
difficulties noticed.
