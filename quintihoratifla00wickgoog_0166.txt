‘Wrtn'n Pompeius at home again saie in limb and rights! Pompeius who
ahared with me the dangers and the snatched pleasures oi the campaign under
Brutus. Alter Philippi we separated. Mercury carried me oli in sasety, you were
swept back again into the war. Snrely you owe Jovea least os thanksgiving. My
lawn shall be the soene oi the revel. Who would think oi sobriety when a lost
friend issonndi’

‘Ad Pompeium Varnm,’ Acr.; and so the Ode is inscribed in the oldest MSS.
Nothing is known oi Pompeius. He has been by some editors wrongly identified
with Pompeius Grosphus, the rich owner oi pasturas in Sicily, Epp. r. 12. 21, Od.
a. 16.

At what point ol the civil war Pompeius abandoned it and availed himself ol an
offered amnesty, or what interval had elapsed since then, there is no indication.
Horace writes as is he had heard nothing ol his old friend ior some years. and he
lm by this time a lawn ol his own on which he can entertain a guest. 'lhe name
oi Pompeius suggests that he may have followed, aiter the battle of Philippi, the
sonares oi Sextus Pompeius, who maintained the war by sea against the Triumvirs
till the year tac. 35.

1 have noticed (Introd. to Odes i-iii. ς 13) that Horace chooses this place in the
middle os the Book which is the least political ior the reminiscence oi his boyish
indiscretion and ior his tribute to alost cause.
