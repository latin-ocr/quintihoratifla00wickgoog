O DE XXIV.

live more wisely, with no settled homes, no stores of wealth. They have not the
vices oi cirilized llfe. Their women do not poison their step-children, nor rnle
their husbands, nor break their marriage vows. Who would be known as the
saviour aud father of his country? let him check the licence of the time. He
may be hated by his contemporaries, bnt he will be glorious to all ages. It isuo
good to compinin z—punish the offenders :-n0 good to make laws, while our lives
give the lie to them, while we scour sea and land for the sake of money, and think
poverty the one shame. let ns get quit of our wealth: root ont the evil if we are
really tired of it, and train our sons iu a manlier school. [et them hant instead
of playing with the Greek hoop and the dice, while their fathers are cheating to
heap up money for them, their unworthy heirs. That is the way weulth grows;
and it is au endless business, for it never cau keep pace with desire?

The Ode travels over the same ground as much of Odes 1, a, 3 and6 of this
Book. We mayuote also how many of its expressions recur in the Odes (especially Ι
⁵ and 15) oi Book iv, which celebrate the reforma as accomplished.
