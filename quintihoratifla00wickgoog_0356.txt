INTRODUCTION

ΤΟ THE

CARMEN SAECULARE.

Iu the Mon. Ancyranum (Mommsen, c. 22) Augustus tells us that
he celebrated the Secular Games in the consulship os C. Furnius and
C. Silanus (nc. ιγ) with Agrippa as colleague‚ and on behals ol the
‘college oi Quindecimviri.'

Suetonius (Oct. 31) mentions the ‘ Ludi Saeculares' amongst ‘non-
nulla ex antiquis caerimoniis paulatim abolita’ which Augustus revived.
Dion also (54. 18) mentions the celebration, giving the year, and saying
that it prosessed to be the fifth time ol the observance.

The first extant account ol their origin and earlier celebrations is in
the treatise ol Censorinus (in the second halt ol the third century an.)
‘de die Natali‚' c. 17.

The games os which they professed to he the revival went under
the Republic by the name oi Tarentini (or Terentini) and Taurii, the
former name being connected by all writers with the ‘stagna Tarenti'
or ‘Terenti' a spot at the north edge ol the Campus Martius, near
the river, once a swamp, and probably a warm spring (see Burn’s
Rome and tbe Campagna, p. 300), the locality of some os the chief
ceremonies even in Augustus' celebration.

Their origin according to some ol the authorities, according to
others their second celebration, was ascribed to Val. Publicola. All
agree that they had only been celebrated lour times belore the age ol
Augustus. There is no trace ol the name ‘Saeculares’ before that
date, and what is said of the different celebrations goes to show that ’
they were called forth by special emergencies, not by any recurrence
