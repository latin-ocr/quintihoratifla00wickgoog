ODE ΧΙ.

Ὀ Mettensi und my lyre, tcach me some strain that will win the obdunte ear
of Lyde. She is like ayoung unhrolren coit: but music has made tigers and forest
trees and rivers stay to listen. 1t has tnmed Cerberus, and beguiled the pain of
Ixion aad Tityus and the Danaids with their leukiug pitchers Let Lyde henr
their tale-how they slew their husbands, all seve one-their punishment, und

Hypermnestra's undying glory.'

Lyde iswamed not ‘placito pugnare amori’ hythe story of the Dansids und
their punishment, und the noble exception of Hypermuestru The applicetion of
the story is not very close. 'l‘he form of the Ode seems to be u nearer imitation
than usual of the construction of un Ode of Pindum the commencemeut by nn
invocation of Mercury aad the lyre3 the occidental way in which, through the
recountnl of the fests of music, the Dnnaids cre introduced; the myth told st
length, but left to be applied by the readers wit. Compare 3. 3 und 3. ²7·

For the story of the Danaids recd Aesch. Pr. V. 853-869 and Or. Her. 14
‘Hypermuestra Lynceo‚’ which contains frequent reminiscences und expressions of
passages in this Ode. Compare vv. 3, 4 ‘Clausa domo teneor gravibusyue coer·
cita vinclis: Est mihi supplicii causa fuisse piam,' &c with vv. 45, 46 of the Ode,
vv. 35, 36 with 41 foll, vv. 73, 74 ‘Surge age, Belide, dc tot modo fratribus unns;
Nox tibi, ni properas, ista perennis erit,’ with vv. 37, 38, and vv. ray-130 with
v. 51, see note.

Ritter suggests that the story would be especially familiar to the Roman public
at the time when Horace was writing these Odcs, from the fact that n group of the
Danaids formed a chief feature ln the portico of the temple of Apollo on the Pala·
tine, which Augustus dedicated in se. 28 (see Od. 1. 31). Prop. 3. 23. 4, Ov. A. A.
