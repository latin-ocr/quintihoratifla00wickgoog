EPODE IV.

Α vtotttttr attaclr on some freedman, who moved the wrath ot' Horace nnd ol the
citizens by his display und arrogance. ‘A little while ago flogged ns n slave: now

We can hardly doubt that the Epode wns nlmed st some roal person. The
Scholiasts say Menas, or Menodorns, the t'reedmnn und friend os Sextus Pompeius
(see on Od. 3. 16. 1⁶), who, in ne. 38, being then in command oi n lleet und oi

sor n short time to the service ot his old master, but again deserted to Octavianus,
and wss received, il not to confidence, yet to employment. He died in ³5·
Various difficulties have been felt iu this identification. The nbsenoe oi any
mention oi the fickleness and treachery ot' Menos, hns been thought to fix the dare
