Torua onas. 9

on which Horace’s text rests which made conjectura} emendation,
if not specially necessary, at least specially tempting. Necessary of
course it was not, in the sense in which it is necessary in the text
of Aeschylus or of Lucretius, to restore sense or metre in a chaos;
but in a way the multiplicity of MSS. tempts us to do for one author
what the poverty of MSS. almost compels us to do for another.
A variety of readings, all consistent with metre and intelligible, and
all resting on fairly equal MS. testimony, must impiy the hand of one
or more emenders of the text at an early period. It is a natural
interpretation to assume in such a case that all alike are attempts,
more or less skilful, to fill up a gap in the original authority3 and
this once believed, a scholar of the roth or 17th centuries may not
unreasonably think himself as competent to guess the riddle asa
scholar of the fourth or fifth. It is manifest that no impassable barrier
separates cases where the MSS. are divided from those where they are
consentient. Division is onlya sign of the disease. We have already
seen that it is confessedly possible for the same blunder to infest
every MS. Α modern editor will probably set aside, as a rule, purely
conjecturat emendations; at any rate, he will hesitate to give them

the reality which is implied by printing them in the text; not because ο

he denies the possibility of corruptions, or does not feel the plausi·
bility of many conjectures, but only because experience has taught us
that there is no necessary limit even to the cleverest and most plau-
sible guessing, and because it cannot be proved that in such a text as
that of Horace guessing on a large scale is necessary. One more
remark may be allowed. An editor with the feelings which l have
described will yet feel bound to recall, and to some extent to discuss,
the more famous conjectures which have become part of the literary
history of his author, and in doing so he will run the risk, at times, of
seeming to treat great names ungraciously. It must be remembered
therefore that to have learnt to distrust a method is not to deny the
genius of those who used it, and who, by showing us its results at
its best, have taught us the limits of its capability. The solid value
of Bentley’s edition is diminished very little by the fact that very
many of his conclusions are such as we cannot now accept with any
confidence or even accept at all. There is hardly a question in
Horatian exegesis that is not raised by him, and raised, if at times in
a form rather more logical than befits the criticism of a poet, yet
always with a precision and strength, as well as with a fulness of
knowledge, which at least (and it is an editor's chief fonction) makes
us understand and measure the difficulty.
