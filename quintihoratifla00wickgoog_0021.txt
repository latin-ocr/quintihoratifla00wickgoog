a GENERAL INTRODUCTION

partly because quotations seem often to be made from memory, partly
because the quotation is most commonly made for some metrical
or grammatical reason which is not affected by the special word
or form in respect of which the doubt exista and therefore the testi·
mony to the reading is not in truth older than the MSS. (not usually
very ancient) of the grammatical author himself.

So far, then, as external testimony goes, it is clear that when adis·
puted reading occurs, the evidence to which we can appeal to determine
it contains in every department some elementa of uncertainty, and is not
lilrely to be rated at the same relative value by all critica. Can the MSS.
be made, by any process of comparison, to testify, through common
readings, to sources of evidence older than themselves, older even than
the Scholia? Has the value of any ‘special MS. been unduly esti·
maledi Is a particular Scholium genuine, or is it an interpolation
to suit the reading of MSS. themselves of no great antiquity? There
will remain these and other previous questions upon which perfect
agreement cannot always be obtained; and, in default of such
agreement, an editor or a reader cau hardly form his judgments too
modestly. It must not be supposed, however, that the criticism of
Horace's tert, any more than the criticism of other classical texts,
turns by any means entirely upon the testimony of MSS. or Scholia
However far these carry us back, they leave us, on the one hand, with
the certainty that varieties of reading existed, and that emendation on

’ grammatical or other grounds had been at worlu still earlier: and,

on the other hand, they leave, if not very many blots which modern
criticism has unanimously recognized and corrected, yet enough of
these¹ to make us feel that when the question lies between an i or an
c, an e or an a, one or other expansion of an ambiguous abbreviation,
and the like, MS. testimony cannot be held to settle it absolutely,
without any appeal to grammar or sense. We must add that in the
maj0rity of really doubtful readings no theory with respect to the
external testimony will elicit other than an ambiguous answer from it.
ln these, if to the end we must give full room to doubt, we can
hardly help balancing in our minds the fitness on other grounds
of the rival claimants.

¹ Such as ‘ter' in Epod. 4. 8, ‘hic ut all known MSS. but one have ‘ Nereus,'
Mucius illi' in Epp. 2. 2. 89, which no ‘Nerea' The certain form ‘Alyattei’in
editor would retain. The mistakes in Od. 3.16.4r‚has had tuberestored by .

Homer, show that they had the right unmetrical ‘tricenis' iu Oda. 14.5,l1as
name in Od. 3. πο. 15, Epod. 15. aa, but overwhelming MS. support.
