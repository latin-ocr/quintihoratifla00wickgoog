ODE IX.

⁸ Do not despise the office oi the lyric poet, Lollius Pindar's poenis live, unex-
tinguished by Homer's greater name; and so do those oi Simonides, Alcaeus,
Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho. Before Homer sang, many a Helen loved, many
a Troy was besieged, manya Hector or Deiphobus fought aad died ior wile and
children. Why are they unwept, unknown? Because ffiey had no inspired chroni-
cler; and, when once iorgotten, what good is leit oi their heroism? It shall not
be so with you, Lollius, ii 1 can help it. Yon have the mind oi a statesmau-clear
aighted, well balanced, prooi against avarica, ruler oi all things, because it mles
itseli. Such is the one wise and happy maa, who is independent oi circumstanoet,
who cau use prosperity well, and not shrialr from poverty or death in a good
cause?

Lollius (⁴ M. Lollius M. F! His cognomen is unknown, see on Epp. 1. 2. ι)
had been consul lac. 21 (Epp. r. 20. 28). For his temporary deleat by the Sygam-
bri in uc. 16 see Introd. to this Book. His character stands very low with
other writers Pliny, H. N. 9. 35. 58, and Vell. Patere. a. 9, accuse him specially
oi avarice and venality. This is in strange contradiction to Horace's panegyric, iu
which such stress is laid on his ireedom from these particular vices. The Public
voice can hardly, at the time Horace wrote, have endorsed the accusations, or the
boldness oi meeting Lollius' calumniators on their own ground would have raised
ridicule rather than sympathy. Something no doubt must be deducted from Vel·
leius’ testimony on the score oi his partiality to Tiberius, whose enmity Lollius
had specially incurred (Suet. Tib. 12, 13), and Pliny would very likely have followed
Velleius But Lollius, notwithstanding the iailure of his German campaign,
