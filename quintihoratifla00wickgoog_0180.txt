world irom the quarter they dn not expecu‘ Next, suggested hythe 'leti Vis

abode oi happy sonia, among them ’ (here comes the last change) ‘those whom the
Iyrie poet would first looir ior, Sappho and Alcaeus. An admiring throng of
sbades is round both, but the larger and the more attentive round Alcaeus What
