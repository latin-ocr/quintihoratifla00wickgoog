Ο DE XXXIV.

‘ 1 scaturiunt my old Epicurean doctrine oi the '⁴ careless'' gods (Sat. r. 5. ror).
1 have heard thunder not where Lucretius might explain it to me from clashing
clouds, but in a cloudless sky, where 1 could not bnt recognize it as the rolling ol
the chariot wheels that shake all creation. Itis the rame hand that lannchea
‘⁴ bolts from a clear sky '¹ in human things, that lit'ts the humble and overthrows
the proud when men least expect it.’

Horace is thinking ol the challenge with which Lucretius clenches his argument
that thunder comes irom purely natural causes :—

‘Denique cur numquam caelo iacit undique puro
Iuppiter in terras tulmen sonitusque profunditl’-6. 400.

tudes ol Phraates and Tiridates on the Parthian throne (aee Introd. to Odcs i-iii, ᾖ 8l,
though the expressions iu vv. 14 soll. are not particular enough to necessitate this
interpretation. The iramework oi the Ode bears some resemblance to that of

This in both cases stands in the middle ol the Ode, introduced by the emphatic
‘namque' (ι. aa. 9l: it is the ground oi the statements that precede and follow.
What he has witnessed in this case, and the cause to which alone he can truce it,
justily both the general recantation oi staura 1, and the solution which he gives in
stannea oi the difficulty iu the human world which seems to him analogous to
the thunder, sor which no ‘secondary cauae’ waa to be found, in the material
world.
