THE TEXT, Mss, SCHOLIASTS, EDITIONS.

Are editor whose knowledge oi MSS. is chiefly at second-hand
owes some apology, at least to himself, ior discussing questions
of text; but he can hardly avoid such discussion. Even ii he
chooses an existing text as his guide throughout, he must by his
choice virtually take a side in many intricate questions, and he does
so in the way which is the least instructive to his render, by appearing
to settle without discussion questions which are really open. Happily
the text oi Horace isone in which, if some points must always
remain in uncertainty, the uncertainty isos a very bearable kind.
The worst result oi a bad judgrnent will usually be only to prefer the
least probable oi tvo readings, either oi which has much to say sot
itsell, makes good sense, and hasbeen supported by great scholars.

It will be seen that the MSS. of Horace, though very'numerous,
are not very ancient. There are none, like the uncial MSS. of Virgil,
oi palmary authority. There are a considerable number which are ·
placed between the end ol the ninth and tenth centuries; only one
now extant which belongs undoubtedly to the ninth, and that defective
in respect ol nearly all the Satires and all the Epistles except the
Ars Poetica. We have (hut these also in comparativelylate MSS.)
Scholia which are generally believed to date, in their original form,
lrorn the third to the fifth century.

Occasionally, where doubt hangs over the form oi some salient
expression in Horace, we find light thrown upon it by more or less
certain imitations of it in Ovid, or in the later Roman poets. Lastly,
we have numerous quotations, chiefly in the grammatical authors
of the first five centuries. These are rarely os any very high value;
