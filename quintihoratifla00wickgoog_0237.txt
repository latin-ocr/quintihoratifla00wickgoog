218 HORATI CARMINUM

Gygen? Ille Notis actus ad Oricum
Post insana Caprae sidera frigidas
Noctes non sine multis
insomnis lacrimis agit.
Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,
Suspirare Chloe'n et miseram tuis
Dicens ignibus uri,
Temptat mille vafer modis.
Ut Proetum mulier perfida credulum
Falsis impulerit criminibus, nimis
Casto Bellerophonti
Maturare necem, refert.
Narrat paene datum Pelea Tartaro,
Magnessam Hippolyten dum fugit abstinens3
