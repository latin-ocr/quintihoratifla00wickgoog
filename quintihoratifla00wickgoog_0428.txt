COMPLEMENTARY INFlNITlVE. 409

‘durus componere,' Sat. r. 4. 8.

‘veraces cecinisse,’ Carrn. Sec. 25.

‘blandus ducere,' Od. 1. ra. 10.

‘largus donare,' Od. 4. 12. 19.

‘lenis recludere,’ Od. r. 24. 17; ‘aperire’ Carm. Sec. 13.

‘saevus fingere,' Epp. r. 15. 30.

‘impotens quidlibet sperare,' Od. 1. 37. ro.

‘nobilis superare,' Od. r. 12. 26.

‘ridiculus absorbere,’ Sat. a. 8. 24·

‘utilis aspirare,' A. Ρ. 204.

The broad resemblance holds between all these that the infinitiva

names the action in relation to which the adjective is applicable.
There is room, however, for considerable difference in the closeness os
tlte relatrhn between thern, and even in tls character.
’ On the first point we may compare ‘celer irasci' or ‘praesens tol·
lere’ with ‘blandum quercus ducere! In either os the first two cases
the adjective and the infinitive are essential to one another-it isa
mere accident ol' language that the ‘irascibility' or the ‘power ol lit -
ing' ia not expressed in a single word-but in the third case the idea
oi each is completee the infinitiva adds an illustration, almost a result,
of the quality named by the adjective, it is almost=‘tam blandus ut
ducat!

On the second point we may notice the change in the relation oi
the infinitive (α) when the adjective to which it is appended is negative
in sense. This is clear in such cases as ‘indoctus ferre,’ ‘ timidus
perire,' ‘piger ferre ἐ it may cause some ambiguity when the negative
character of the adjective is less clear, or where it would have been
equally open to the poet to regard it from its positive side, and to
make the infinitive the complement os the whole, not merely of the
positive part, viz. the attribute denied or disparaged. Contrast, e. g.
‘ferre iugum pariter dolosi' with ‘cautum dignos assumere,' ‘calli-
dum condere,' &c ; (b) in such cases aethe last three given above,
where the adjective and the infinitiva seem to have changed plaoes,
where it is no longer an internal quality oi the subject leading to some
action, but an action which is the cause or ground ol the attribute, no
longer ‘brave so as to conquer,' but ‘famous because he conquers?

‘Niveus videri,' Od 4. 2. 59 (like ‘nefas videre,' Epod. 16.14)‚
seems to be more purely an imitation of a Greek idiom (λεῦκος δρᾶσθαι,
ἀθέμιτον ldeiv).
