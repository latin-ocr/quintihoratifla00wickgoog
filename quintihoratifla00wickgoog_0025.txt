[Also of the tenth century is the MS. in Queen's College, Oxiord,

quoted as ‘Regin.,' oi which a collation is given at the end of this
volume.]

They also assign high value to

γ. Paris, 7975.
Μ. At Mblh, near Vienna

C and E, two parts (which they distinguish, C as oi the eleventh,
Eas of the twelsth century) os a MS. at Munich.
g. A Gotha MS. oi the fifteenth century, which is oi value as
⁴ seeming to be copied in part from V.

Both of the eleventh century.

It has been already suggested, that the only method by which con-
clusive evidence upon questions ol disputed reading could be gathered
from MSS. of such late date, would be by grouping them in families
or ‘recensions’ each family being made by its common readings to
bear witness to some archetype ol much greater antiquitythan the copies
which we now possess. ’

This has been attempted on an elaborate scale by Keller aud Holder.
. Α and α,λ and I, φ and ψ, D and τ, as we have seen, have been
supposed to be severally related in this way, and the readings of their ’
imagined archetypes are indicated by Holder by the signs A', λ’, F, D‘.
We are supposed to have thus—to the extent that uniform readings
can be obtained-a certain number os conjecturally restored MSS.
of greater antiquity than any that are still extant. These'and the
other solitary representatives ol older MSS. are again grouped ‘into
three classes.

The first of these is distinguished as containing, with many faults of
carelessness, and with a certain number os grammatical corrections
(e. g. ‘videri' against the metre in Epod. 16. 14), little orno proof
of alteration on rhetorical or general grounds. In this class are
placed for different parts oi Horace’s poems A, a, D, r, M, y,
E, C, R.

The second class is supposed to show the corrections oi an early
and intelligent emender. That such διορθωταί existed in early times is
stated by the Pseudo-Acron on Ars Poet. 345. And the name of
one is found in the inscription which appears, in slightly different
terms, at the end ol the Epodes in A, λ, l, Regin, g. ‘Vettius Agorius
Basilius Mavortius V. C. et inl. (vir clarissimus et inlustris) Excom.
