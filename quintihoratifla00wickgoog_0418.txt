Cales venenis officina Colchicis. ³5
Quae finis aut quod me manet stipendium?
Effare3 iussas cum fide poenas luam,

Perambulabis astra sidus aureum.

Infamia Helenae Castor offensus vice

Fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece,

Adempta vati reddidere lumina.

Et tu, potes nam, solve me dementia, 45

Neque in sepulcris pauperum prudens anus
Novendiales dissipare pulveres.
