Potamua uncti? Dissipat Euius
Curas edaces. Quis puer ocius
Restinguet ardentis Falerni
Pocula praetereunte lympha?
Quis devium scortum eliciet domo
Lyden? Eburna, dic age, eum lyra
Maturet in comptum lacaenae
More comas religata nodum.

ODE Xll.

‘N0, Maecenas, my lyric style will not do ior the great ieata oi Roman arms,
any more than it would lor the heroic myths. You will celebrate Caesar’s glories
lar better in your prose history. 1 will content mysell with singing the charms oi
your Licymnia aud your love lor her.’

With the Ode generally compare 1. 6.

The Scholiasts (on Sat. 1. a. 64) give the tradition that Licymnia is a name
invented by Horace to veil and yet to represent to the initiated that os Terentia,
Maecenas’ wife. (See lntrod. to Ode a. ιο.) Many stories are told ol her beauty
aud ol her influence over Maecenas, as well as ol the trouble she gave him. Horace
reminds him ol the dny, perhaps, when he first saw her, dancing in Diaua's temple.
Bentley pointed out that the mention ot' the public dance in Diana’a honour.
implies that the person imagined is not merely a ‘ libertina'

'she third stauza seems clearly (though Orelli doubts it, taking ‘tu’ generally
‘you’ or ‘any oue’) to imply a hope or a wish that Maecenas may write some
memoirs ol the reign of Augustus. Servius (on Virg. G. 2. ⁴²) vouches lor his
having done so; but the only older authority that can be quoted is a doubtful
expression ol Pliny, N. li. 7. 46.
