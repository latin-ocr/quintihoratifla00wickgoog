HORACE'S EARLY LlFE IN HIS WRlTINGS.

Nonae-Quintus, Sat. 2. 6. 37.
,, Horatius, Od. 4. 6. 44, Epp. r. 14. 5.
„ Flaccus, Sat. 2. r. 18, Epod. 15. 12.

[Oi the origin of the ‘cognomen' nothing can be guessed. T he
‘nomen' might imply that his father, on manumission, had taken a
gentile name from some member of the Horatia gens. It is now
more generally believed, on a suggestion of G. F. Groteiend, that it
was derived from the Horatia tribus, the one of the country tribes in
which the colony of Venusia was enrolled, and to which Horace's

father, as a libertus of Venusia, would belong]

, nc. 65. Date ‹ffBr‘rth—The year is given in Od. 3.22. 2, Epod.

23. 6, Epp. 1. 20. 26-28. The last reference adds the mouth.
Suetonius completes it by fixing the day, ‘Sexto idus Decern-
bris,' December the 8th.

may compare the familiarity of his mention of scenes in Apulia,
Od. 3. 4. 9-26, Sat. r. 5. 77; the river Aufidus, Od. 4. 14. 25,
cp. Sat. 2. 2. 583 the Fons Bandusiae (i), Od. 3. 133 Mons
Vultur, Od. 3. 4. 9; Garganum Pr, Od. 2. 9. 7, Epp. 2. 1. 2023
Litus Matinum, Od. 1. 28. 3, cp. 4. 2. 27, Epod. 16. 28 ;
Luceria, Od. 3. 15. 7; the wolves on the Apulian hilis, r. 22. 23,
33. 7. See also on the fondness with which he attributes to the
Apuliad all Roman virtues, Od. 2. 22. 23, 2. 2. 34, 3. 5. 9, 16. 26,
Epod 2. 42¹.
