it would be necessary to conclude) within a year or two 01 that great
disappointment 01 2122 hopes 01 Rome and 01 2122 Emperor.

An argument, second only in weight to this, is founded upon the
Odes (2. ro and 3. 19) which have reference to Licinius Murena, the
brother 01 Terentia, Maecenas’ wile (see also on Od. 2. 2. 5). Murena
was executed 102 participation with Fannius Caepio in a conspiracy
against Augustus in nc. 22. The presumption seems very strong
that even 11 Ηο2222’2 feelings would have allowed him to publish these
poems‚ and especially Od. 2. 20, 21222 1212 lriend’s catastrophe, he
would have been deterred by the knowledge that the reminiscences
must be displeasing to Maecenas 22 well asto Augvrstus. Franke
recalls the story 01 Virgil’s striking out the praises 01 Gallus from
the end 01 Georg. iv on somewhat similar grounds.

The arguments 102 postponing the publication 01 the Odes to
a later date are not such as can really be set against these con·
siderations. They tum mainly on Od. r. 3, which is taken to refer
to the voyage 01 Virgil to Athens in the last year 01 1212 1112, nc. 19:
and on the supposed allusions (the strongest case is Od. 2. 9) to the
expedition 01 Tiberius into Armenia, and the restoration 01 2122
standards by the Parthians in nc. 20. Some remarks on these points
will be iound in the Introductions to Od. 1. 3 and a. 9. There re-
mains the possibility that these (and 11 212222, 212222 021222) Odes may
have been inserted aller the first publication. It will be seen that this
is not likely to have been the case with 1. 3; and the theory 01 any
such insertions is perhaps hardly compatible with that pause in 12212
composition between the publication 01 Books i-iii and the com-
mencement 01 Book iv, which is implied in Suetonius’ statement, and
in Horace's own words, Od. 4. 1. 1, Epp. 1. 1. 1-1o.

ξ 3. When we pass from the general epoch to the dale 22 special Odes
we are on less 2212 ground. A very lew can be fixed with exactness.
Such are 1. 31, which is written 102 2122 dedication 01 2122 temple 01
Apollo Palatinus in nc. 28; 2. 4, which Horace dates himself in .
nc. 25, by reference to his own age; 1. 24 and 3. 14, both 01 which
are fixed to nc. 24, the one by the known date 01 2122 death 01 Quin·
tilius, the other 1222122 return 01 Augustus from Spain. We may
perhaps add a few, though in their case 01 course more latitude must
be given, which speak in terms 01 near anticipation 01 political events
which can themselves be dated. Such are 1. 35, which represents
Augustus as on the point 01 starting 102 Britain, a purpose 102 which
we know that he set out from Rome in nc. 27 (see Introd. to that
