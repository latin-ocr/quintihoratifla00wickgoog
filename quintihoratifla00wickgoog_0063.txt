44 HORATI CARMINUM

The form oi the Ode may have been suggested by a poem ol Callimachus, the
beginning oi which is preserved :-
d ναῦς ἃ τὸ μόνον φέγγος ἐμὸν rd γλυκὺ τᾶς §oda
dprufus, aori τυ Ζᾶνος tortam λιμενοσκόπω.

Statius' Propempticon Matio Celeri, Sylv. 3. a, is in great part an expansion oi
Horace’s poem. We may contrast Horace’s wishes for the voyage ol an enemy,
Epod. 10.

The tirade against sea-travelling as one form oi man’s restless audacity is in part
playiul; and as Prot. Sellar (Roman Poets oi the Augustas Age, p. 120) suggests,
adopted to Virgil's own temperament and expressed ieelings: but Horace recum
to the idea that commerce aud the mingling oi nations are against nature and
a source oi evil, and that ii the golden age could return they would cease;
