262 HORATI CARMINUM

ODE XXV.

ΙΝ this Ode, as in a. 19, Horace has tried to catch the inspiratiou oi a Greek
dithyramb. In that oue he professes to recall the eifects which the sight oi
Bacchus had upon him: iu the present one he is actually ander the inlinenoe oi
the afflatus. ‘ lle is hurried away, whither he kuows not: hiseyes are opened οι
strange caverus and river-bunius aud woods. His tongue will be loosed in ι
moment to sing no humble theme, aud in no common straiu, the glories of Caesar:
he follows the god. ior he must, and it is delightiul, but it is iearful too?

The glory ol Caesaris only mentioned as the subject oi the coming burst oi

song; but the place oi honour given to it isin effect the celebratior which is
promised. See 1.6‚1utrod.
