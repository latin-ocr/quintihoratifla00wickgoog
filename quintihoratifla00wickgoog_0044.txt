ODES, BOOKS 1-111.

Il—THE ORDER OF THE ODES, AND THEIR
DIVISION INTO THREE BOOKS.

ξ 9. in the preceding pages 1 have assumed the correctness of the
traditional view that Books i-iii form a unity. How far particular
Odes or groups of Odes may have been shown to friends or given
wider publicity before the whole collection was complete, it is of -
course beyond our power to guess: but we mean that the three Books
were arranged as we have them by Horace himself, at one time, and
intended to bc read as a whole.

§ro This cau hardly be said to rest on external evidence, for
although the words of Suetonius, ‘tribus carminum libris ex longo
intervallo quartum addere,' lend themselves to the idea of such
a substantia} unity of the earlier Books, they do not necessitate it;
but the internal evidence in its favour is very strong. In other cases
where Horace's poems are divided into ‘Books’ there is a correspond-
ing difference of personal and historical background which explains ’

the division: these three ‘Books' reflect the same time; all their
references to persons and events point, as we have seen, to a single
period ol about seven years. Whatever be their principle of arrange·
ment, whether within the separate Books or as between them, it is
not chronological ¹. The only Ode than can be with confideuce dated
as early as sc. 30 is ι. 37. Of two Odes which can be definitely
placed in s.c. ²4 one isin the third Book, the other iu the first (3. 14,
1. 24). Od. r. ιι belongs almost certainly to the later years of that
period. The Odes which turn on the two synchronous personal
events, the poet’s escape from the falling tree and the recovery of
Maecenas from dangerous illness, are distributed between the three
Books, and the one which must be latest in composition (1. ιο) is in
the first Book. The view based on such considerations is seen to
harmoniae with indications of unity within the poems themselves. It
seems to be implied in the analogy which we notice between the
