ODE V.

‘Jovs's thunder proves him the sovereign oi the slry. Augustus shsll prove
himself a god upon earth by adding to the empire Britain and the hateiul
Parthians-O shann to think oi the disgrnoe not yet wiped swayl-Roman
soldiers living as captives, iorgetiul oi name and country, and country’s gods.
This was the danger that Regulus soresaw ii prisonem were allowed ιο hope ior
ransom-“ Lei them die,” he said, “and pity them not. l have seen with my
own eyes the sight oi emmer Roman standards nailed up in Punic temples with
armonr that was taken not irorn the dead but irom the living :-Roman unoens
with their hands bound behind their backs—Canhage peaceinl aud busy :-the
worlr oi our war audone. Will you buy those soldiers back again? It will be
s waste oi money. The deer caught in the net does not hght again ii yon loose it,
nor does the man who has once ieared death make a soldier again He does not
lrnow what war means.” He put aside his wile and children, and hung his head
as one disgraced, till the senate listened to his advice; then he went back to tortnre
and death with as light s heart aa if he were going ior a holiday.'

Another phase oi Augustus’ mle. He is to retrieve the deeply·felt disgrsoe of
Carrhae, and to restore the healthy military spirit os ancient Rome. We have in
the story oi Regulus at once a measure oi the disgraoe ιο be retrieved.-‘ lt is the
very disgraoe which he ieared and loretold and went back to the torture in order
to prevent’- and a picture oi the true Roman spirit which is to be reawalrened.

The whole sentiment oi the speech may be compared with Liv. aa. 59-61.
The story oi Regulns' mission to Rome is not iound in Polybius, a lact which

has been held to throw doubt on its truth. It issnmmarised inthe Epitomeoi
