HORATI CARMINUM

ODE IX.

⁴ ‘Tris most continuone ruins, the lougest wintere, end a't last. Let not your
grief for Mystes alone be uueuding, Valgius. Not even Nestor grieved inconsol-
ably for the son of his old age, nor hia parents and sistere for the blooming
Troilus 'Tis time to cesse from wailings more womunly thnu theirs, and to sing
of Caesafs triumphs!

The Ode is addressed to C. Valgius Rufus, a poet whose elegies are referred to
aad quoted by Servius ou Virg. E. 7. aa, and Aen. 11. 457. The scattered and
doubtful hints which can be gleaued about him will be found in the Dict. Biog.
He stands iu Sat. ι. ιο. lla vn‘th Varius, Maecenas, Virgll, and tbe other select few
for whose litersry approbatius Horace ceres. The Scholiasts spenk of him as
a ‘Consularis' and the name occurs in the Consular F asti, tac. ιι.

The date of this Ode should be fixed by vy. 18—24. but the references of these
lines is a sultject of controversy. They have been used as oue of their chief argu·
ments bythose who put the publication of the Three Books as late as mc. 19, being

interpreted of the events of the year ao, when Augustus was himself iu Asia and
Tiberius under his orders advsneed into Armenia (see Epp. ι. ιι. ²648).

The lines mn hardly be disconuected from the passage in Virg. G. 3„ 30 foll. :-

⁴Addum urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten,
fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis,
Et duo rupta manu diverso ex hoste tropaea.
Bisque triumphatus utroque ub litore gentes:

which on this theory must have been inserted iu the last year of Virgil‘s life.
Mr. James Gow (Classical Rev. vol. 9, p. 30² foll.) has made ont a strong ense for
referring both passages to the year ²5· Augustus was then at Tarraco, in Spain.
detained by illustres and during that time we are told (Mommsen, Res Gest. Div.
Aug. p. 133. Orosius 6. ar. 19) an embussy from the Scythae (Geloni v. ²3) mme
to him. He was offered by the senates triumph for victory over the Cantabri and
Salassi. Mr. Gow thinks that ‘nova tropaea’ refers to an actual monument of
victory, such as the arch still standing ut Aosta which Mommsen identifies with
oue named by Dion (53. 26) as having been erected at this time, or that which
gives its name to Turbia over Nice. The double triumph over Eust and West so
emphasiaed by Virgil, will mesu the triumph over the Cantabrica as following the
triumphs of ²9 over enemies to the East of Rome.

NON semper imbres nubibus hispidos

vexant inaequales procellae
Usque, nec Armeniis in oris,
