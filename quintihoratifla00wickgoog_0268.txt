ODE XXI.

ll'ntmu iu anticipatiou of entertaining M. Valerius Messala Corvinus. Dill'. ‚
bids us compare with this Ode Epp. 1. 5.

‘Jar of Messio, ns old es myself, your potent contenis were kept for some
happy occasion, eud they shall be bronched today for Corvinus. He, philosopher
as be is, will not despise you Old Cato, they tell us, did not object to a cup of
wine. Yon make genius flow; you give fresh hope to the anxious end couruge to
the poor. With yonr help, and Liber end Venus and the Grecos, we will keep the
bmqnet up till dnyligbt'

Corvinus (the ‘Messala’ of Sat. 1. 6. 42, 1. ro. 85, A. P. 371 ‘diserti Mes·
salne') was, like Pollio, at once distinguished in the politicul ond thc literery
world He hed belonged to the senatorium party, and turned Octaviunns’ fisnk in
the int day’s fighting at Philippi. He subsequently joined Octavianus against
Antony, and commanded the centre of bis fleet at Actium After the settlement

he retired from active life, and devoted himself to oratory and literature. He was ·
the great friend und petron of Tibullus.
With tbe fourth and tifth stnnms should be compared Ovid's imitation, A. Α. 1.
